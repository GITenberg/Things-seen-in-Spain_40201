13</span>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE FASCINATION OF SPAIN</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Spain the Home of Romance&mdash;The
Conservatism of the People&mdash;Spain the most Democratic of
Countries&mdash;The Tradition of Chivalry&mdash;The
Cid&mdash;Spain the Connecting Link between Europe and
Africa&mdash;The Place of the Moor in the Country

National Importance&mdash;Spanish Dancing.</p>
<p>Coming into Spain by any of the chief portals&mdash;at Port
Bou, at Algeciras, or at Irun&mdash;one finds oneself in a
totally new country.&nbsp; You cast much behind you as you come,
for instance, from France; you will be impressed by a certain
strangeness of aspect far different from all you have learnt to
expect <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in
other countries.&nbsp; You will feel transplanted back into
another world.&nbsp; It is as if Spain had sat aside waiting,
indifferent and proud, while elsewhere life has rushed
onwards.</p>
<p>The conservatism of Spain may be gathered from the old
impressions we find in the pages of writers describing the people
and the country of more than a century ago, which are still true
in so much as they refer to what is essential in the national
spirit, and to the survival of the customs of medi&aelig;val
Europe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I regard the Spanish people,&rdquo; says
Stendhal, &ldquo;as the living representatives of the Middle
Ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spain is still the home of the romance which belonged to an
age that has passed.&nbsp; And although the more flourishing
Spanish towns are nowadays full of animation&mdash;factories are
springing up and signs of commercial activity are not
wanting&mdash;this new movement of progress has not destroyed
this romance.&nbsp; The Spain which Cervantes immortalized still
lives.&nbsp; We may still take Don Quixote and Sancho Panza as
typical <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>figures, whom you may see any day in the towns of
Castile or walking on the roads of La Mancha.&nbsp; These are the
types that have remained unchanged.</p>
<p>And herein rests the fascination of Spain&mdash;this
conservatism which has lasted into an age of hurrying
progress.&nbsp; It is a fascination that everyone will not feel,
but for those whom it touches the glamour is more permanent and
irresistible than that of any other country I know.</p>
<p>Many details of life, and especially in the smaller towns
still unvisited by the tourist, remind us of a past that other
countries have left behind.&nbsp; The <i>serenos</i>, or night
watchmen, with long hooded cloaks, tipped staves, and lanterns,
are familiar figures in every town.&nbsp; In the country the
shepherd is seen, wrapped in his coloured blanket, leaning on his
tall staff in the midst of his flock.&nbsp; The wandering palmer
with his cockle-shell, known to the England of Chaucer, may still
be met in Spain.</p>
<p>You realize how far you are from the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>present when
you enter a Spanish town.&nbsp; You pass under a Moorish gateway,
dark and imposing, with a suggestion of savage strength in its
gaunt yellow masonry that carries memories of battles that have
been fought.&nbsp; Here you wait for the <i>consumos</i> to
examine your luggage, which, if they doubt your honesty, they
will probe with their long steel prong.&nbsp; The dull jangle
from the bells of your straining mules gives an unaccustomed
sound as you drive upwards, for almost every Spanish town is set
upon a hill.</p>
<p>If the town is small, the <i>posada</i> where you seek for
lodging will have a wineshop below.&nbsp; You will see a crowd of
wild-looking men, with great cloaks and <i>sombreros</i> pulled
low upon their foreheads, seated at a rude table.&nbsp; They are
taking wine from the <i>bota</i>, the long-spouted leather bottle
from which only the Spaniard has the skill to drink.&nbsp;
Thoughts of brigands will crowd your mind.&nbsp; But you need
have no fear; these are simple townsmen.&nbsp; Savage looks and
this strange, wild appearance cover the simple friendliness of
the child.&nbsp; The <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>excited conversation will cease as
you enter.&nbsp; Most likely you will hear the word
&ldquo;Franc&eacute;ses&rdquo; muttered by one and another, for
in Spain every foreigner is first taken to be French.&nbsp; You
answer, &ldquo;No, Ingl&eacute;ses.&rdquo;&nbsp; At once an
atmosphere of friendliness springs up, and an exchange of
greetings will be made.&nbsp; No one will take any further notice
of you.&nbsp; It is not the custom of the Spanish landlord to
force his attentions upon his guests.&nbsp; He is
constitutionally incapable of the obsequious fussiness that
belongs to commercial hospitality.&nbsp; You will be accepted as
one of the family, and the friendly trustfulness that is one
characteristic of the fine Spanish courtesy will soon cause the
foreign <i>caballero</i> to feel at home.</p>
<p>Spain is still the most democratic of countries.&nbsp; Every
Spaniard expects as a matter of right to be treated as an
equal.&nbsp; It is significant that the title <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>
is given alike to God and to a beggar.&nbsp; Your host at the
<i>posada</i> will sit down with you to meals, and his son, who
waits upon you, will slap you <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>on the back with easy friendliness as
he makes plans for your enjoyment.&nbsp; These familiar and
intimate relationships, which once were common in every country,
are found to-day nowhere so universally practised as in
Spain.&nbsp; Each Spaniard that you meet gives the greeting which
commends you to God.&nbsp; And no native ever eats in company
without first uttering the customary <i>gusta</i>, an invitation
to share in the repast, which is a survival, most probably, of
the belief of primitive peoples in the evil eye that poisons the
food of those who eat alone.</p>

<p>The snobbery that has arisen out of modern progress is unknown
to the Spanish man and woman.&nbsp; Business is not here the
highest aim of life.&nbsp; The Spaniard still feels true what
Ganivet made Hernan Cortes say: &ldquo;The grandest enterprises
are those in which money has no part, and the cost falls entirely
on the brain and heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hustling, besmirching
spirit of commercialism is absent from the Spanish character; and
for this reason, although Spain belongs to the past, <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the country,
to those who have eyes to see, will seem to belong also to the
future.</p>
<p>El Mitayo Cid Campeador, as the old chronicles affectionately
call the Spanish hero, with his democratic manners, his
rough-and-ready justice, and his acts at once ideal and yet
practical in achievement, is the supreme representative of
chivalry.&nbsp; Valour and virtue, the qualities peculiarly
identified with the Spanish romantic spirit, were his.&nbsp; His
energy in warfare, his power in love, his childlike religious
faith, and his fearlessness in facing pain and also death, are
characteristics that belong to all the men who have made Spain
great.</p>
<p>Spain was the land of the sword, and the business of the true
Spaniard was war.&nbsp; And this love of action, strange as it
may seem to those accustomed to think of the lazy Spaniard, is a
very real trait in the Spanish character.&nbsp; But the action
must be connected with romance.&nbsp; It has nothing at all to do
with the idea of working for the gain of money which belongs to
the &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>spirit of modern civilization.&nbsp;
The Spaniard works as the child works, for joy, and not for
gain.</p>
<p>Living in Spain, you come to understand that this land is
really the connecting link between Europe and Africa.&nbsp; Both
in his physical traits and in his character, the Spaniard shows
his relation to the North African type&mdash;&ldquo;the child of
a European father by an Abyssinian mother&rdquo; he has been
called.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; Lithe and vigorous, with
long-shaped heads and rich pigmentation of skin&mdash;the type is
clearly seen in the pictures of Murillo and Zurbaran, and with a
more vivid expression in the portraits of El Greco&mdash;the
Spaniard has more points of contact with the Eastern than with
the Western races.&nbsp; Seldom indeed is he entirely a
European.</p>
<p>But it is among the women that the resemblance stands out most
clearly.&nbsp; There are women with dark long African
faces.&nbsp; You will see them among the <i>flamencas</i> of
Seville, or in the gipsy quarter of the Camino <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>del Sacro
Monte at Granada&mdash;women with slow, sinuous movements, which
you notice best when you see them dance, and wonderful eyes that
flash a slow fire, quite unforgettable in their strange
beauty.</p>
<p>In dress we still find the Oriental love of bright and violent
colours.&nbsp; The elegant Manilla shawls and the mantilla, which
give such special distinction to the women of Spain, are
modifications of the Eastern veil.&nbsp; The elaborately dressed
hair, built up with combs, with the rose or carnation giving a
note of colour, has also a very ancient origin.&nbsp; Then, the
men in some districts still retain the fashion of loose, baggy
trousers such as women wear in the East.</p>
<p>We see the Moorish influence in the Oriental seclusion of the
houses, with the barred windows and high gates, often studded
with bosses, seeming to forbid an entrance.&nbsp; The Spaniard
still constructs his house as the Moors built their houses,
around the inner court, or <i>patio</i>, those gardens of colour
and rest, sometimes quite hidden from the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>passer-by, as
at Toledo; sometimes visible through an openwork iron gateway,
like the gay <i>patios</i> of Seville.&nbsp; Each house still has
its <i>buzon</i>, and is fronted with a <i>zagu&aacute;n</i>, or
vestibule of wood.</p>
<p>In every department of Spanish life we meet with this
persistence of the Moorish influence.&nbsp; This need not
surprise us.</p>
<p>The coming of the Moors into Spain was a civilizing expedition
more than a conquest.&nbsp; It was the Orient entering
Europe.&nbsp; The invaders&mdash;for the most part Berbers with a
few Arabs&mdash;were a race of young and vigorous culture, of
such astonishing and rapid growth that, although in Africa they
had hardly emerged from savagery, in Spain they manifested a
truly wonderful receptivity, and absorbed and developed the best
elements they found in the life of the country.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In two years the Moors became masters, and under their
dominion, from the eighth to the fifteenth century, the most
elevated and opulent civilization flourished.&nbsp; All <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the arts,
sciences, industries, inventions, and culture, of the old
civilization budded out into fresh discoveries of creative
energy.&nbsp; Religious toleration came with them, and was lost
with them.&nbsp; The spirit of chivalry arose among the Moors,
and was afterwards appropriated by the Christian warriors of the
North.&nbsp; A Moorish knight was in every respect like a Spanish
knight.&nbsp; It was religion alone that divided them&mdash;one
called on the name of Allah, the other on that of Christ.</p>
<p>We must remember that the primitive Iberians of Spain were
themselves of Berber stock, and this affinity in racial origin
explains the peaceful amalgamation of the conquerors with the
conquered.&nbsp; Afterwards by the constant mingling of their
bloods the Moors and the old Spaniards became one.&nbsp; The Moor
gave to the Spaniard and he took from him, and they contributed
to the same work of national civilization.</p>
<p>Ganivet has said truly that those who deny the Moorish
influence show themselves <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>unable to comprehend the Spanish
character.&nbsp; The Moorish dominion ended, passing almost as
swiftly as it came.&nbsp; But the spirit of their exquisite
civilization, perhaps the most exquisite that the world has yet
seen, moulded their Christian conquerors into its likeness.&nbsp;
And penetrating the Spanish character, and the daily life and
habits of the people, this influence remains; indeed, it is not
overstating the truth to say that to-day the pulse of the land
still beats with Moorish life.</p>
<p>It is in the gardens of Spain that the stranger will find best
the reflection of the Moorish spirit.&nbsp; The Moors made their
cities places of gardens and waters.&nbsp; The very names that
they gave to their pleasure places speak of joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Meadow of Murmuring Waters,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Garden of the
Water-wheel&rdquo;&mdash;what magic lingers in the suggestion of
the words!</p>
<p>Many of these old gardens have perished.&nbsp; Cordova has
lost all except its Orange Court and the old garden of the ruined
Alc&aacute;zar.&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>In Seville the parks are new.&nbsp;
But in Granada the gardens have triumphed over the devastations
of the Christians; and it is one of the exquisite surprises of
the place to come suddenly on some fragment of a delicious garden
where the Moorish tradition lives almost undisturbed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p31.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>There are few cities, even in Spain, that hold so many
gardens.&nbsp; There is the Alameda of the Alhambra, the green
garden which lies around the Moorish citadel; the <i>paseos</i>
on the banks of the Genil, planted with trees and cooled by
fountains, the pleasure-grounds of the people; and the
Jard&iacute;n de los Adarves, on the south terrace of the
Alhambra hill, a trellised retreat, with climbing vines and
flowers, and splendid view of Vega and distant snow-capped
hills.&nbsp; Everyone will find in these gardens something that
makes special appeal to him.</p>
<p>But the most exquisite haunt even among the gardens of Granada
is the Generalife&mdash;the summer palace of the Moorish Princes,
at the foot of the Cerro de Sol, and to the <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>east of the
Alhambra hill.&nbsp; Here you have the charm of small and perfect
gardens laid out in terraces, with great clipped cypresses,
myrtles, and orange-trees, and the glow of flowers, with that of
the delicate Moorish architecture, of richly coloured tiles and
rare inscriptions.&nbsp; And everywhere is the joyous sound of
flowing water; the fountains are always playing, and water runs
in channels made of inverted tiles placed on the top of the
balustrades.&nbsp; One of the charms of Moorish life was the love
of pure water.</p>
<p>An old legend says that the name Generalife in Arabic
signifies the &ldquo;house of love, of dancing, and of
pleasure,&rdquo; and, further, that it was built by one Omar, a
passionate lover of music, that he might retire here and entirely
give himself up to that amusement.&nbsp; The story is probably
untrue, and the name, as the chronicles state, is a corruption of
the Arabic &ldquo;Djennat-al<sup>&rsquo;</sup>-Arif,&rdquo; which
means &ldquo;the garden of Arif.&rdquo;&nbsp; But romance so
often is more beautiful than fact.&nbsp; One likes to think that
this exquisite palace and gardens were <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>designed as a place wherein a man
could give his soul to music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming place!&nbsp; Thy garden is embellished with
flowers which repose upon their stalks and exhale the sweetest
perfumes; fresh air agitates the orange-trees and spreads abroad
the sweet odour of its blossoms.&nbsp; I hear voluptuous music
joined to the rustling of the leaves of thy grove.&nbsp;
Everything around is harmonious, green, and flowering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is part of the inscription upon the arcades of the Garden
of the Pond, and how perfectly the rich imagery of the words
conveys the charm of the garden!&nbsp; The Generalife has kept
more than any place in Spain its Moorish character, combining in
its palace and garden, in spite of decay and alterations, much of
that full suggestion of all beautiful things that was their
gift.</p>
<p>In Spain dancing is something more than an amusement; it is a
serious art closely connected with religious ritual, which
expresses, perhaps as nothing else does, if we except the
bull-fight, the true spirit of the people.&nbsp; The dances are
Eastern in their <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>origin; they are dramas of love, and especially those of
the Gitanas, who have adopted and kept living the ancient dances
of the country.</p>
<p>Seville, the joyous southern capital, is the city that has
given its own spirit to the most beautiful of the Spanish
dances.&nbsp; Granada and Malaga are also centres of dancing, and
sometimes good performances may be witnessed at Madrid.&nbsp; But
the best <i>caf&eacute;s cantantes</i>, where the true Spanish
dancers perform, are hidden in back streets where the foreigner
does not readily find them.&nbsp; These dances are national
ceremonies and belong to the people, and are far different from
the dances, often quite modern in character, that are given at
the popular <i>caf&eacute;s</i>.&nbsp; The varieties are
numerous, and the names are often confusing.&nbsp; Many dances
date back far into antiquity, while almost all owe their special
character to Arabic influences.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The <i>bolero</i> is the most aristocratic dance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What majesty, what decorum, what distinction!&rdquo; <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>cried Valera,
speaking of the dances of Ruiz and his daughter Conchita.&nbsp;
It is danced by a man and a woman, and is a kind of drama between
them; both use castanets.&nbsp; It is a slow dance of deliberate
grace and fascination.&nbsp; The <i>jota</i> is danced by a woman
alone.&nbsp; This dance, too, is a love drama of intense passion,
but always decorous, always beautiful.&nbsp; Both these dances
are native to Andalusia, the province of Spanish dancing.&nbsp;
Outside of Andalusia, the most famous dance is the Aragonese
<i>jota</i>.&nbsp; This is danced by a man and a woman, and the
castanets are used.&nbsp; But the drama is different, the
movements are quicker and less varied, and there is great
vivacity.&nbsp; It seems a kind of combat between the two
dancers; it is more a drama of battle than a drama of love.</p>
<p>But the most typical of all Spanish dancing is the
<i>flamenco</i> dance of the Gitanas, which you will see best at
Seville; it is the most primitive and the most African of
all.&nbsp; A group of performers sit in a semicircle upon a small
stage.&nbsp; The spectators all take their <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>part by a
rhythmic clapping of hands and stamping feet.&nbsp; One of the
performers&mdash;generally a man&mdash;plays the guitar and sings
an accompanying song.&nbsp; A dancer rises suddenly,
spontaneously, as if seized by the passion of the music.&nbsp;
She wears a long dress, usually of white, and a beautiful Manilla
shawl is folded on her shoulders.&nbsp; How can one describe the
dance which is so unlike all other dances?&nbsp; It is not a
dance of the feet; every part of the body plays its share in the
performance: the swaying figure, the beckoning hands, the
glittering smiles that come and go in the dark eyes&mdash;all
contribute.&nbsp; The dancer is alive to her fingertips, and
every expressive movement has the Spanish simplicity of
emphasis.&nbsp; At first the movement is slow, then faster, and
now increases and rises to a passion of intensity.&nbsp; And all
the time the spectators are actively participating, their emotion
rising with the dancer&rsquo;s emotion; their rhythmic clapping
and beating of feet grows louder as the drama proceeds, and cries
of long-drawn-out <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span><i>oles</i> stimulate the dancer.&nbsp; The dance ends
as unexpectedly as it began: a pause comes, and the swaying body
is still, as if languor had followed on strong emotion.&nbsp;
There is silence; the dancer goes back to her seat.&nbsp; Then
the singer starts a new song, the clapping is taken up again,
another dancer comes forward, and a new drama is acted.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The foreigner who would understand Spain must see these
dances; then he will come to know yet another characteristic of
the people&mdash;their love of strong, quite elemental
sensation.&nbsp; It is this that so often makes them seem cruel
to us.</p>
<p>This delight of the Spaniard in all emotions that make sharp
appeal to the senses explains the existence of the bull-fight,
the national sport, which is so much a part of the life of the
people that, although to-day there is a widespread movement to
repress, or at least to mitigate, its cruelty, it seems unlikely
that its real attraction will cease.</p>
<p>It is impossible not to condemn the bull-fight; its cruelty
cannot be denied.&nbsp; It is <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>brutal, as the most cultivated
Spaniards themselves admit.&nbsp; And yet there are certain facts
that the stranger must remember before he condemns.&nbsp; The
bull-fight, like the dance, is a solemn ritual rather than an
amusement.&nbsp; The combats take place on Sunday, while the most
famous form part of the ceremonies of Holy Week.&nbsp; Part of
the proceeds are devoted to some religious object&mdash;a charity
or other holy work.&nbsp; Almost all the great bull-rings have a
chapel where the fighters first prepare themselves in prayer and
partake of the Holy Eucharist.&nbsp; To the foreigner it may seem
that this union of religion and bull-fighting is incongruous, but
to most Spaniards it does not appear so.</p>
<p>The bull-fight is the Spaniard&rsquo;s strongest, most
characteristic intoxication.&nbsp; The poor man will sell his
shirt to buy a ticket for the bull-ring.&nbsp; They are a
profoundly serious people, but every incident connected with
their national sport arouses them into vivid life.&nbsp; I
remember on one occasion, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>when travelling in Andalusia in an
open third-class railway carriage, the train passed a
<i>vacada</i>, or training-place of bulls to be used in the
ring.&nbsp; The effect was magical.&nbsp; These quiet, sombre
people sprang upon the seats, some leaned far out of the windows;
they gesticulated, they waved their sombreros, they called the
names of the bulls, they cheered, they shouted.&nbsp; Never had I
seen the decorous Spaniard so strongly moved.</p>
<p>The <i>toreros</i> are the idols of the Spanish people.&nbsp;
You will see them best at Seville, in their faultless tight
<i>majo</i> costumes and frilled shirts, fastened with diamond
studs, and diamond rings on the fingers of their faultless hands,
and with their pigtail fastened upon the top of their
heads.&nbsp; There is something splendidly attractive in their
perfect bodily equipoise, with every muscle trained to faultless
precision.&nbsp; The <i>toreros</i> have in the highest degree
strength, agility, and grace.&nbsp; Even women have been
<i>toreros</i> and Madame Dieulafoy tells of one
<i>Do&ntilde;a</i>, Maria de Gaucin, who left her convent to <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>become a
<i>torero</i>; then, after gaining renown throughout Spain for
her exploits in the bull-ring, returned to the practices of
religion.&nbsp; Only in Spain would such division of a life be
thought perfectly natural, perfectly seemly.</p>

<p>The bull-fight was established in Spain in the eleventh or
twelfth century, and is of Moorish origin.&nbsp; The bull would
also seem to have come first from Africa.&nbsp; But the
spectacular and ceremonial character of the contest is certainly
adapted from the Roman combats, the influence of which had
survived among the old Spaniards.</p>
<p>Every Spanish town has its Plaza de Toros.&nbsp; Here, and
especially at Seville during the Easter festival, you will see
all the population of the place, a motley crowd of men and
women.&nbsp; Se&ntilde;oras in white lace <i>mantillas</i> and
white dresses, and their cavaliers, the gay <i>Sevillanos</i>,
side by side with the <i>gente flamenca</i> and the
<i>cigarreras</i> in lovely shawls, their hair elaborately
arranged, with a white flower showing against its <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>blackness;
for the bull-fight is a democratic institution, where the
greatest foregather with the people.&nbsp; The patience of the
vast crowd is perfect as they await the advent of the appointed
hour.&nbsp; All are animated with a suppressed seriousness, the
prelude to violent emotion which is so characteristic of the
Spaniard.</p>
<p>The entire performance is carried out with an elaborate
ceremony of detail which the stranger often finds difficult to
appreciate.&nbsp; The President enters his <i>palco</i>.&nbsp;
Then follows the <i>paseo de la cuadrilla</i>, the processional
entrance of the bull-fighters, grave, handsome men, in their
beautiful and varied costumes of yellow and violet, gold and
green, or whatever the chosen colours may be.&nbsp; The
procession moves slowly across the ring; there is no haste.&nbsp;
Each one in turn gravely and with perfect grace salutes the
President, who then throws down the key of the bulls&rsquo; den,
the <i>toril</i>.&nbsp; In a few moments the first bull rushes
into the arena.&nbsp; The combat has begun.</p>
<p>The fight is divided into three acts.&nbsp; In <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the <i>Suerte
de Picar</i>, the first, the <i>picadores</i>, dressed in round
felt hats, short cloaks, and long leggings of plaited steel, and
mounted on blindfolded horses, in turn receive the charge of the
bull, thrusting him aside with their long pikes.&nbsp; Sometimes
they come to close quarters, a <i>picador</i> is thrown, his
horse is wounded, or perhaps killed.&nbsp; The shouts of the now
excited crowd show that this is the critical moment.&nbsp; The
<i>picador</i> rises quickly, another horse is brought, while the
<i>chulos</i> divert the attention of the bull by dexterous
waving of their brightly coloured cloaks.&nbsp; When the bull is
sufficiently wearied&mdash;for this is the object of the first
act in the drama&mdash;the President gives a signal, and the
<i>picadores</i> retire.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The <i>banderilleros</i> take their place.&nbsp; This is the
<i>Suerte de Banderillear</i>, the second act, the object of
which is to inflame the bull.&nbsp; The <i>banderilleros</i>
place the barbed darts, or <i>banderillas</i>, in the shoulders
of the bull.&nbsp; Each is about 2 feet long, of curious device,
and ornamented with long coloured streamers.&nbsp; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>It is the
most exciting part of the combat.&nbsp; The utmost skill,
agility, and daring, are needed to plant the darts.&nbsp; There
must be no bungling, no second of hesitation.&nbsp; It is now
that the excitement of the spectators is really aroused, for a
sense of solemnity is given by the possible presence of
death.&nbsp; A <i>banderillero</i> may be seen to seize hold of
the lashing tail, swing himself along the beast&rsquo;s side, and
plant his dart between its horns.&nbsp; It is done with
surprising skill, with delight, and with passion; and the
applause of the spectators swells to a great roar, which refuses
to be silenced.</p>
<p>The last act is the <i>Suerte de Matar</i>.&nbsp; The chief
<i>espada</i> comes into the ring; to him belongs the honour of
the death.&nbsp; First he approaches the President, and solemnly
dedicates to him the slaying of the bull.&nbsp; He is armed with
a short Toledan blade and the <i>muleta</i>, a small red
cloth.&nbsp; Calmly he walks towards the bull.&nbsp; And now a
silence falls upon the hitherto raging crowd.&nbsp; It is the
moment of pause, of silent waiting for the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>most violent
emotion of all.&nbsp; First he plays with the now infuriated and
wearied beast.&nbsp; There is still no hurrying.&nbsp; The
Spaniard wishes always to gain the very utmost out of his
sensations.&nbsp; The bull is teased by the waving of the red
cloth, and in this way is made to take the proper position for
the death-blow.&nbsp; The <i>espada</i> watches his moment; then,
with unerring decision, he buries the blade in the bull&rsquo;s
neck between the shoulders, and walks slowly to the
President&rsquo;s box, with absolute composure and a dignity that
is almost defiant.&nbsp; Deafening cheers greet him, rewards and
costly tributes are thrown, and he is presented with a great
bouquet of flowers.&nbsp; How Spanish is this ending, which
rewards the slayer with flowers!</p>
<p>It is over; the ring is cleared, sand is raked over the pools
of blood, a new bull is driven forward, again the drama
begins.&nbsp; Six times the scene is re-acted, and a seventh
bull, a <i>toro de gracia</i>, is added at the first bull-fight
of the year.</p>

<p>In this repetition of emotions, this delight <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>in heaping up
sensations, we have a very real revelation of the Spanish
temperament.&nbsp; And this explains the devotion of the people
to the bull-fight.&nbsp; When we come to estimate the Spanish
character, we shall find that the Spaniard has the qualities
which belong to all primitive people.&nbsp; The sentiment of
sympathy with suffering is essentially a modern one.&nbsp; The
Spaniard is still the Moor, his ancestor.&nbsp; He is cruel
because he is indifferent to pain, his own or
another&rsquo;s.</p>

58</span>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE SPANISH PEOPLE</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Character of the People&mdash;Their
Quietness and Sobriety&mdash;Their Cruelty&mdash;This the Result
of their Stoicism and Indifference to Pain&mdash;These the
Qualities of a Strong and Primitive People&mdash;The
<i>Feria</i>, the Holiday of the Sevillians&mdash;Religion: its
Place in the National Life&mdash;The Dance of the
<i>Seises</i>&mdash;Holy Week in Seville&mdash;Religious
Processions&mdash;The <i>Pasos</i>.</p>
<p>The character of the Spaniard, as one gradually learns to know
it, not from a brief visit spent tourist fashion in hurrying from
one city to another, but from living among the people, sharing
their common life and entering into their spirit, is a very
positive character.&nbsp; And this character, though at first
seemingly full of contradictions, is one of an almost curious
uniformity, strongly individual, and not easy to comprehend.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>A
significant quality of the Spaniard is his quietness&mdash;the
grave enjoyment which he retains even under the influence of
strong emotion, such as we have seen in the dances and in the
national pastime of the bull-fight.&nbsp; His countenance will
keep its accustomed gravity even whilst his mind is
inflamed.&nbsp; The Spaniard has what one would like to call an
active languor.&nbsp; On the one hand we find in his character a
deeply rooted dislike, which is almost a contempt, for useful
work, with, on the other hand, a reserve of untiring energy and a
special aptitude for violent and emotional action.</p>
<p>In Spain work is not the highest aim of life.&nbsp; This is
the reason why time is of so much less value.&nbsp; It explains
the tendency to delay everything to a convenient
to-morrow&mdash;that annoying <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> with which the
Spaniard cheerfully responds to every demand.</p>
<p>One of the first lessons I learnt in Spain was the
unimportance of time.&nbsp; We were staying in a country village
off the beaten tracks of travel, and had to drive a long <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>distance to
meet the train which was to take us to Madrid.&nbsp; When we
arrived at the small wayside station, we found we had three hours
to wait.&nbsp; There was no waiting-room, no refreshments could
be procured, and it was raining and very cold.&nbsp; I felt
angered at the discomfort and waste of time; but the Spaniards
who were our companions accepted the delay with true
philosophy.&nbsp; They were genuinely distressed at my
annoyance&mdash;the Spaniard is always courteous to the
foreigner&mdash;but they did not at all share it.&nbsp; They
wrapped their great cloaks around them, and walked up and down
the wind-driven platform for three hours, calmly indifferent.</p>
<p>I understood their acceptance of life on its own terms, which
is the very root of the Spanish character, at once its strength
and its weakness, the cause of its beauty and of its defects.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A charge of cruelty is often made against this people.&nbsp;
But the cruelty which one meets so often, and especially in the
treatment of animals, is almost always misunderstood <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>by the
stranger.&nbsp; It arises from a certain hardness of fibre, which
makes the Spaniard indifferent to pain.&nbsp; And if he is cruel
to others, the Spaniard is also cruel to himself.&nbsp; I know of
no people who are as little careful of personal comfort.&nbsp;
Stoicism may be said to be the religion of the true
Spaniard.&nbsp; Every form of asceticism has been practised by
him, and to-day there exist brotherhoods whose members flagellate
themselves with special instruments made of sharp broken glass
till the blood flows, just in the same way as the
<i>banderilleros</i> prick the bulls in the ring.</p>
<p>The Spaniards have always shown an interest in blood and a
satisfaction in shedding it.&nbsp; Two centuries ago it was a
common custom for lovers to scourge themselves in the streets
during Holy Week, to win admiration from their mistresses.&nbsp;
The Spaniard still gains the approval of his women by feats of
daring, and the bull-fighter is the idol of the people.</p>
<p>We find an expression of this insistence on <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>pain in the
Spanish pictures and sculpture.&nbsp; Artists in no other country
have depicted the sufferings of the Christ and the tortures of
martyrs with the same delight of detail.&nbsp; I recall the
pictures of Zurbaran and Ribera, or those agonized images of the
Christ by Juan Juni at Valladolid, in which sorrow is carried to
a distortion that is almost caricature.&nbsp; The Spaniard
accepts these images; he clothes them with little embroidered
skirts and lace petticoats with the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of
a child; to him they are the most poignant expression of his
religious emotion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p65.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Limestone Quarries, Almeria"
title=
"The Limestone Quarries, Almeria"
src="images/p65.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It would seem, then, that in the Spanish character there is
not only an indifference to pain, but an actual delight in the
emotion of suffering, which prevents an understanding of
cruelty.&nbsp; It is the temperament that makes the martyr and
the fanatic.&nbsp; I remember on one occasion some boys were
torturing a young bird, which one boy held by a string tied to
its leg.&nbsp; I offered to buy the bird for a few
<i>reales</i>.&nbsp; At once it was given to me, and I set it
free.&nbsp; But what was the result?&nbsp; In <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>less than an
hour some twenty birds had been caught, fastened to strings, and
were brought to me.&nbsp; No payment was asked: the birds were a
gift to the foreign se&ntilde;ora.&nbsp; The boys had not
understood at all that I disliked their cruelty; they thought
that I had a strange fancy for captive birds.</p>
<p>The incident is characteristic of what the stranger will meet
constantly in Spain.&nbsp; Your driver will flog his mules with
the butt-end of his whip&mdash;yes, beat them till they
fall.&nbsp; If you remonstrate, he will smile, rarely will he be
angry; but never will you make him understand.&nbsp; Once during
a long drive I gained respite for a team of mules at the cost of
a bribe of two pesetas.&nbsp; I know that driver pitied my
foolishness.</p>
<p>Yet, let there be no mistake, the Spaniard is not without the
tenderer emotions of humanity.&nbsp; And, after all one has heard
of Spanish cruelty, it is interesting to note the signs of
gentleness and kindness that meet one in many unexpected
ways.&nbsp; I have never seen any other people so friendly with
one another.&nbsp; <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>The home life of the people, be they rich or poor, is
charming, with a standard of kindness that compares favourably
with that of other countries.&nbsp; Domestic crimes are
comparatively infrequent.&nbsp; The Spaniard is known for his
considerate love for children, and the relations between parents
and children are universally happy.&nbsp; In no country does less
stigma fall upon a child who is born out of wedlock.&nbsp; One of
the strongest impressions I gained during my stay in the
Peninsula was the happiness of the charming children.&nbsp; It is
noteworthy that the first hospital for the insane was established
in the country of the bull-ring.&nbsp; The practice of allowing
counsel to poor persons in criminal cases is of much older origin
than in our own country.&nbsp; The pest of beggars is another
witness to this softness in their character; the Spaniard feels
that it is inhuman to refuse alms.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is when the Spaniard comes into personal relationships that
his real native kindness appears.&nbsp; For his friend he is
ready to sacrifice his life&mdash;a quality which Strabo <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>notes as
belonging to the ancient Iberians.&nbsp; You will often meet with
a curious mingling of cruelty and kindness in the same
individual.&nbsp; I recall a characteristic incident.&nbsp; An
artist friend was sketching in a small town in the province of
Old Castile, and upon one occasion was greatly annoyed by a lad
who threw sand upon the wet canvas, thereby showing, I suppose,
his hostility to the foreigner, whose actions he did not
understand and therefore disliked.&nbsp; The artist, rather than
contend with his rudeness, left the spot and returned home.&nbsp;
By mistake a small purse-bag was left behind.&nbsp; The boy found
it, and followed with it to the hotel.&nbsp; What a change!&nbsp;
There was no rudeness now; instead, a real pleasure in rendering
a service.&nbsp; Smiling and bowing, the persecutor of half an
hour before returned the purse with the fine Spanish courtesy,
refusing to receive any reward.</p>
<p>It is these seemingly contradictory impulses that puzzle the
stranger in estimating the Spanish character.&nbsp; But the truth
is, that <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>the deep-rooted conservatism of the race has kept alive
in the Spaniard of to-day the qualities that belong to primitive
peoples.&nbsp; Mr. Havelock Ellis, the English writer who has
best understood the Spanish spirit, says truly: &ldquo;The
Spaniard is, and remains to-day, in the best sense of the word, a
savage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Spanish nature is elemental, and
responds to all the emotions that touch the elemental passions:
love, religion, war&mdash;these are the emotions that stir life
into action.</p>
<p>Much of what is characteristic of the life of the people may
be studied in the <i>Feria</i>, the great spring festival, which
is held at Seville each year in the middle of April.&nbsp; From
all parts of Spain people flock to the southern city, and for
three days at this national picnic they make holiday
together.&nbsp; In the Prado de San Sebastian streets of wooden
pavilions, or <i>casetas</i>, have been erected, consisting
mainly of one room, which is furnished with chairs, a piano, and
beautiful flowers.&nbsp; Here on each day the families of Seville
assemble in their own <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span><i>caseta</i>, and pass the joyous
hours in receiving guests, dancing, guitar-playing, and
singing.&nbsp; One side of the <i>caseta</i> is entirely open, so
that all can see the company within.&nbsp; The women and the
older men sit upon the chairs; the <i>majos</i>, in faultless
costume, stand about, each smoking his cigarette; the children,
brilliant, fascinating little people, play in front.&nbsp; Some
of the women, and many children, are dressed in the old
Andalusian costume, with black lace over bright yellow silk; all
the women wear <i>mantillas</i> upon their hair.&nbsp; Fans are
fluttering everywhere; there is a soft tinkling of guitars.&nbsp;
Dark eyes flash upon you, and red lips part in smiles as you
stand and look within.&nbsp; It is a family party, carried out
with a publicity that seems strange to us, but is perfectly
natural to the Spaniard.&nbsp; At the <i>Feria</i> everyone is
accepted as a friend.&nbsp; Someone clicks a pair of castanets,
and a beautiful girl gets up to dance the <i>seguidilla</i>, that
most graceful dance which every Andalusian child is taught.&nbsp;
The effect on the company <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>is magical.&nbsp; How animated they
are! every face is smiling.&nbsp; Their chairs are drawn in a
circle around the dancer, whom they applaud with rhythmic
clapping.&nbsp; It is the <i>seguidilla</i>, with its gracious
memories, which gives life to the <i>Feria</i>.</p>
<p>In another part of the fair the Gitanas have their
tents.&nbsp; All the women from Triana and the Macarena are here,
amusing themselves simply and quietly with a joyous
decorum.&nbsp; Some of the Gitana women are remarkably handsome;
all have superb hair, and the gay colours of their dresses give
brightness to the scene.&nbsp; There is dancing here, too, the
<i>flamenco</i> dances, with slow movements and passionate
suggestion of love, and the noise of the constant clapping of the
spectators.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the outskirts, in the open space of the Prado, are flocks
of sheep and goats, and droves of bullocks, horses, mules, and
donkeys, tended by picturesque herdsmen and muleteers in the
dress of the several provinces.&nbsp; <i>Caballeros</i> ride
their horses up and down to show off their points.&nbsp; The <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>vendors
haggle and chaffer with the buyers, for all the animals are for
sale; but all is good-natured, there is no quarrelling.&nbsp; At
intervals there are little <i>ventas</i>, or refreshment booths,
where the people buy a <i>refresco</i>.&nbsp; Families are
camping and picnicking on the grass.&nbsp; Others are seated on
chairs arranged in a circle around the couple who rise to
dance.&nbsp; At a little distance there are swings for the
children.&nbsp; The noise is great&mdash;the Spaniards delight in
loud sounds&mdash;concertinas and barrel-organs, the sounds from
the castanets of the dancers, and the loud clapping of hands,
mingling with the cries of the <i>aguadores</i> and the vendors
of shell-fish and chestnuts.&nbsp; Here, too, everyone is happy;
but you will not see one drunken or quarrelsome person; among all
the people there is a friendly, good-natured content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seville,&rdquo; it has been said, &ldquo;lights up for
a <i>fiesta</i> as a face lights up with a smile.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And evening is the time at which the <i>Feria</i> looks its
best.&nbsp; The great iron tower in the centre of the park is
brilliantly illuminated, <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and the avenues of <i>casetas</i>,
radiating in every direction, are softly lighted with thousands
of fairy lights, electric lamps, and Chinese lanterns; in each a
different scheme of colour prevails.&nbsp; The soft warm air is
fragrant with the scent of the blossoming orange-trees.&nbsp; In
each <i>caseta</i> there is a dancer, and from the open doors
eager faces look out upon the passers-by.&nbsp; The sound of
castanets and guitars is heard in every direction.&nbsp; The
broad walks are filled with people, an unending stream, slowly
walking up and down.&nbsp; This is the true Spain, idle, joyous,
brilliant, happily content, making the very most of life with the
fine acceptance that is the gift of the Sevillians.</p>
<p>It is this spirit which the Spaniards have brought into their
religion&mdash;the understanding that joy is a part of
worship.&nbsp; And although Seville is not a religious city as
Toledo and Valencia are, it is here that the splendid ceremonies
of the Church are carried out with more detail and spectacular
appeal than in any city in Spain.&nbsp; The Sevillians <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>have made the
ritual of their religion a part of their life&rsquo;s
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Nothing shows this better than the strange medi&aelig;val
custom of the <i>Seises</i>, the sacred dances which take place
in the cathedral on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and
on that of Corpus Christi.&nbsp; The sixteen <i>seises</i>, or
choristers, dance in front of the high-altar, using castanets and
singing in the most charming and graceful minuet fashion.&nbsp;
It is perfectly dignified, perfectly religious, and the young
dancers perform without a suspicion of levity.&nbsp; There is
something specially characteristic of the Spaniards&rsquo;
attitude towards religion in thus making dancing a part of the
sacred ritual of the Church.&nbsp; Just as the bull-fight is
carried out as a solemn ceremony, so dancing, the people&rsquo;s
strongest passion, finds its place in the service of the house of
God.&nbsp; To the stranger it is an astonishing ceremony, a
witness to the pagan element that lives so persistently in the
Spaniard&mdash;the cause of those sharp contrasts that surprise
us in his character.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>All
Spain gathers in Seville to take part in the great festival,
which is held during the <i>Semana Santa</i>, the Holy Week of
Easter.&nbsp; It is the people&rsquo;s holiday as truly as is the
<i>Feria</i>; both are &ldquo;holy days.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p81.jpg">
<img alt=
"A Village &ldquo;Pasos.&rdquo;"
title=
"A Village &ldquo;Pasos.&rdquo;"
src="images/p81.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The most characteristic of the ceremonies are the religious
processions, which take place on each day during the week, and
all day long on Good Friday.&nbsp; At Granada and many other
towns the Church processions have been given up; but at Seville
the custom remains unchanged from the Middle Ages.&nbsp; The
whole city is given up to the <i>pasos</i>, vehicular traffic is
stopped, all business ceases.&nbsp; Everyone, from the Archbishop
and the <i>Alcalde</i> downwards, assembles in the public
squares, where seats are erected, in the streets, or in the
balconies and windows of the houses, to witness the
performance.&nbsp; It is an amazing sight, this multitude
gathered to watch the procession of an image!&nbsp; But the
Spaniards give themselves up to it with simple abandonment.&nbsp;
Nothing seen in Spain will give so true an impression of the part
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>that
religion takes in the life of the people.&nbsp; The stranger will
feel himself carried back at least three centuries.</p>
<p>The <i>pasos</i>, which are carried in these processions,
consist of a single sacred figure, or a group of figures
illustrating a scene from the Passion.&nbsp; Many of the statues
have real beauty; they are the work of Monta&ntilde;&eacute;s,
the seventeenth-century sculptor, whose polychrome carvings
express so perfectly the Spanish religious spirit.&nbsp; Borne by
twenty-five invisible carriers, at an extremely slow pace, the
sacred groups pass through the streets of the city.&nbsp; Each
<i>paso</i> is followed by the members of the <i>cofradia</i>, or
brotherhood, to whom the statue belongs.&nbsp; They are dressed
in the costume of their Order, the long gown, usually of white
cloth, with the peaked cowl covering the head.&nbsp; Each brother
carries a lighted candle.&nbsp; Companies of acolytes, white and
scarlet robed, swing censers and chant anthems.&nbsp; A line of
gendarmes, in capes of vivid red, march in advance to clear the
way.&nbsp; Women clad in <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>white walk beside them; barefooted,
they are fulfilling a vow.&nbsp; The sacred figures, and
especially the Virgin, to whom the chivalrous Spaniard has always
rendered his homage, are vested in rich gowns of silk and velvet,
enriched with jewels of such great price that a soldier with
drawn sword walks on guard behind.&nbsp; The platforms on which
the statues rest are thickset with lighted tapers and laden with
flowers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The slow procession proceeds through the densely crowded
streets and squares to the accompaniment of solemn music, with
which mingle the <i>vivas</i> and <i>bravas</i> of the
spectators.&nbsp; Before the doors of the City Hall there is a
pause to greet the <i>Alcalde</i>, who rises from his velvet
chair.&nbsp; Then the procession passes onwards through the
reverent, bare-headed crowd to the cathedral.&nbsp; The women,
black-robed and with black <i>mantillas</i>, in the balconies,
where rows of lamps and candles burn, rise in reverence.&nbsp;
One and another sings an ardent petition, with eyes fastened on
the sacred figure.&nbsp; Now a young <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>girl presses forward in the crowd
with a gift of marigolds, which are placed at the Virgin&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>There is a completeness and simplicity in the worship, the
great crowd, rich and poor, women and men, all moved by one
strong emotion.&nbsp; And the spell of the strange scene
penetrates the spirit; one forgets its pagan, medi&aelig;val
childishness; one begins to understand how these outward symbols
have had power to hold the faith of the people.</p>
<p>The cathedral is the chief centre of all the ceremonies; and
the vast edifice&mdash;Santa Maria is the largest Gothic church
in the world&mdash;which is not too vast for its part in the
great functions, is seen best on these days of festival.&nbsp;
The gold and silver plate, all the splendid Church
treasures&mdash;silver candelabra beyond counting, jewelled
censers, chalices, and crosses, golden keys and diamond stars,
Arfe&rsquo;s rich and delicate monstrance&mdash;have been laid
out by the side of the great altar.&nbsp; Crimson drapings cover
the walls; the priests <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>wear their <i>terno celeste</i>,
vestments of blue and gold.&nbsp; The great doors are wide open,
and all day long the people come and go in endless procession, as
the pageants of the <i>pasos</i> arrive and then depart.&nbsp;
The Mass, with its elaborate ritual, is sung to the Spanish music
of Eslava; the Sacrament is borne in priestly procession.&nbsp;
Each day has its special function.&nbsp; On Palm Sunday is the
consecration of the palms and olive branches; on Maundy Thursday
the typical Spanish ceremony of the washing of feet takes place;
on Good Friday there is the Passion Sermon; and on Saturday the
<i>Cirio Pascual</i>, the great candle, 25 feet high and
770&ndash;880 pounds in weight, is consecrated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>All the days the cathedral is filled with relays upon relays
of worshippers: some kneel upon the bare stones, one by one or in
groups together; some stand; others sit on the chairs they have
brought with them.&nbsp; The black dresses and <i>mantillas</i>
of the women mingle with the bright colours of the peasants who
have come from the country districts.&nbsp; There <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>is something
social, well-nigh domestic, in the scene.&nbsp; In the intervals
between their devotions the women chatter loudly together and use
their fans; children play about as if in their own homes; even
dogs and cats are there, quite unmolested.&nbsp; The Spaniard is
wholly at home in his church, which to him is so much a part of
the world and his daily life that he can talk, eat, sleep, and
transact business, there.</p>
<p>As the week advances an indescribable emotion grows, which
culminates on the Saturday, when, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, the Veil of the Temple is rent in twain.&nbsp; The great
purple curtain, which has hung in front of Roldan&rsquo;s
beautiful Christ upon the Cross, is sharply drawn by hidden
cords.&nbsp; The signal is given; all the bells of the city ring
out joyously, the great organ peals forth jubilees of victory,
<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> soars out in choral chants.&nbsp; It is
the moment of supreme emotion.&nbsp; The multitude falls upon its
knees before the great symbol of the accomplished Passion.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>This is
the end of the Holy Week ceremonies.&nbsp; The women put off
their black, and now appear in white lace <i>mantillas</i> and
dresses predominantly white.&nbsp; In the afternoon the
children&rsquo;s festival of the lambs takes place.&nbsp; Then on
Easter Sunday the bull-fight is celebrated.</p>

<p>Toledo has kept, perhaps, more than any city in Spain its
medi&aelig;val aspect, combining in its buildings of so many
civilizations that here remain together; churches, convents,
mosques, Gothic walls and ornaments, Moorish houses and steep
passages&mdash;everywhere the Moorish design is evident&mdash;and
a great Christian cathedral&mdash;much of what is most typical of
the genuine Spanish civilization.&nbsp; <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>I know of no
city that can give a more poignant emotion than Toledo.</p>
<p>A great town, set on its rough and elevated rock of granite in
the midst of the blue Sierra, closely ringed by the deep brown
water of the Tajo, it is like no other city in the world.&nbsp;
The national character, strong and aloof, passionate and
brilliant, and the nation&rsquo;s history, are here epitomized
before you.&nbsp; And coming to the city, as the stranger does,
from Madrid, blatant, noisy, and modern, you will feel
transplanted back into an older world.</p>
<p>Your first impression is of something extraordinarily
austere.&nbsp; You seem to have passed into silence and an almost
painful absence of life.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Toledo has remained as the Moors built it, a tortuous network
of cobbled alleys, as was most fitting in a city built upon rock,
scorched by sun in summer, and in winter swept with icy
winds.&nbsp; The tall houses, rising in straight <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>upward lines
like an arrangement of flat walls, are almost all windowless on
the side next to the street; where there is a window it is barred
and closely latticed, and the high gates are studded with iron
bosses and seem to forbid an entrance.&nbsp; No sight of the
tree-shaded court is given, as at Seville and Cordova.&nbsp; No
one appears to go in and out of these doors.&nbsp; Every house
has the aspect of a prison; they all look as if they had
histories.</p>
<p>There is the same absence of bustling modern life in the
streets.&nbsp; In the Calle del Comercio there are shops, but the
wares are simple, having an old-world air; only specially
interesting is that of Alvarez, the best maker of
damascene.&nbsp; Even in the Zocodover, the centre of the
city&rsquo;s business, all is sedate.&nbsp; You will see the
water-carriers driving their mules up the steep streets from the
<i>vega</i>, a peasant whose beast is laden with bright-coloured
fruits and vegetables, or a group of goats that supply the milk
for the city.&nbsp; Yet often the streets seem deserted.&nbsp;
Only the companies of beggar children, who clamour <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>incessantly
around you with their strange cry, &ldquo;Un caukie sou!&nbsp; Un
caukie sou!&rdquo; remind you of the life hidden in the sleeping
city.</p>
<p>Romance lives in Toledo.&nbsp; How many scenes and how many
figures famous in Spain&rsquo;s history are recalled to our
memory here.&nbsp; In no other city are there the same number of
architectural monuments.&nbsp; It is the chief centre of the two
great elements of Spanish civilization, the Christian and the
Arab, which makes it the place where the native art can best be
studied.&nbsp; Its cathedral and churches are furnished with the
most perfect examples of the industrial arts that have been
produced in the Peninsula.&nbsp; El Greco, who adopted Toledo as
his home, expresses in his pictures, which are one of the great
possessions of the city, the Toledan spirit, which is the spirit
of Spain.&nbsp; The churches are the museums and
picture-galleries of the city; each one has its special
appeal&mdash;its precious mosaics, its ironwork, its glass
windows, its cloisters, its tombs, its beautiful carvings, or its
pictures.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>In
Toledo you understand the part that religion has taken in the
history of the country.&nbsp; You can hardly walk for five
minutes in any direction without coming upon some church; they
stand at the corner of almost every square, many are embedded
between the brown walls of the houses.</p>
<p>Its architecture shows a curious mingling of Arab, Gothic, and
Renaissance work.&nbsp; Christian and Moor overlap in many
buildings, while in others the art of each emerges isolated and
independent.&nbsp; In the great cathedral, the perfection of
Gothic in Spain, we see nothing of the Moor, while in the mosque
of Bel-el-pardon, now called El Cristo de la Luz, and in the
ancient mosque in the Calle de las Tornarias, which has never
been converted to Christian uses, and retains its original
character almost unimpaired, we can with difficulty trace the
Christian.&nbsp; But in other buildings&mdash;the Sinagoga del
Tr&aacute;nsito, for instance&mdash;we find the Moorish
traditions persisting with the Christian.&nbsp; And it is this
intermingling and <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>absorption of the Moorish civilization with the
Christian that gives the real character to Toledo.&nbsp; Not only
in the churches that once were mosques does the passage of that
great people remain, but in the houses, austere without but
beautiful within, in ancient palaces, in fragments of gardens
that still are places of rest, in embattled bridge and arch, in
exquisite harmonies of ornament that meet you everywhere, and,
more than all, we find this gracious influence in the spirit of
the city itself.&nbsp; Toledo is a living picture, a city in
which each building is a voice that speaks the history of
Spain.</p>
<p>In Cordova, and even in Granada, you are less sharply
conscious of the Moorish influence.</p>

<p>Time, the tamer of proud cities, has shadowed Granada, and to
visit it is to understand the desolation of conquest.&nbsp; The
big hotels, placed so incongruously near to the Alhambra, the
clamorous guides, the beggars&mdash;all the disagreeable
conditions of a show city that trades on its past are here.&nbsp;
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>The
efforts of recent years, that have developed a certain amount of
industrial activity, have not lessened this impression; for
modern enterprise seems strangely out of place in Granada, while
the attempts to improve the old city, such as the boulevard which
has been driven through its centre, have been left unfinished,
with a result of added desolation.&nbsp; In the air itself there
seems something of decay, as the white mists from the snowy
heights of the Sierra Nevada rest shroud-like upon the
<i>vega</i>.&nbsp; Always you seem to catch an echo of that
<i>ultimo suspiro del Moro</i>.&nbsp; Ruins meet you everywhere;
only the gardens in Granada have kept the charm of their
exquisite beauty.</p>
<p>But there is one possession that conquest has left to
Granada.&nbsp; It is to see the Alhambra that everyone comes to
the city, which is but a setting to this Moorish jewel.&nbsp; And
in the wooded garden, which lies around the citadel, where
nightingales sing, and flowers embroider the grass, and the sound
of running water is always heard, Granada, <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>with its
memories of ruin, seems shut off as by a veil of quiet.&nbsp; The
Alhambra is the supreme pearl of Moorish art in Spain.&nbsp; It
is bewildering in the appeal of its strange beauty.&nbsp; It is
like an invocation of an Eastern sorcerer, and as you wander in
its courts and halls the Thousand and One Nights seem true.&nbsp;
It is hardly conceivable that people lived here.&nbsp; You seem
to understand the brilliant dominion of the Moors in Spain.&nbsp;
Only people with a history like theirs could have reigned here;
life lived here could but have been a romance.</p>
<p>The first impression you gather from the almost bewildering
beauty is how any building so seemingly fragile can be so
strong.&nbsp; More than five centuries have passed since the
Alhambra was built.&nbsp; The repeated earthquakes which did so
much damage to Granada, and laid in ruin the Renaissance palace
of Charles V., have been powerless to destroy this most delicate
of architectural structures.&nbsp; To-day the Alhambra is kept as
a show-place, rejuvenated by the restorer.&nbsp; <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>But even
this has not been able to dim the exquisite beauty of its courts
and halls.&nbsp; And all the jewelled weaving of ornaments, so
difficult to grasp as being quite real, have kept much of their
splendour.&nbsp; It almost seems as though the common
superstition were true, and that the charm of Fate does guard the
Red Palace of the Moors.</p>
<p>Cordova suffers from the memory of a past greatness which she
cannot now support.&nbsp; Gautier describes the city as <i>le
squelette blanch&eacute; et calcin&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Cordova is
a city in sleep; it rests in a quiet and beautiful dream.&nbsp;
Here the Eastern spirit of acceptance echoes with an unsilenced
voice.&nbsp; And this is why the sensitive stranger will find
such perfect satisfaction in the white city&rsquo;s sleeping
peace.&nbsp; Cordova was the town that I most loved in Spain.</p>
<p>But the tourist goes to Cordova in haste to visit the
mosque.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mezquita?&nbsp; Mezquita?&rdquo;&nbsp; Each
Cordovese you encounter will surmise your desire and direct you
without question.&nbsp; They know that this <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>imperishable building is the one interesting lion in
their city; it is to visit it that the stranger comes to
Cordova.</p>
<p>The great mosque is a &ldquo;wonder of the world,&rdquo; the
one perfectly satisfying building left in the city of the Khalif,
the Cordova that was known as &ldquo;the Bride of
Andalusia.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Church of the Divine Wisdom is the
most complete expression in building that the Moors have left in
Spain, more even than the Alhambra.&nbsp; It is one of the
buildings that sum up the genius of a people, the experience of a
race, and the teaching of a school.</p>
<p>In the Outer Court of Oranges, where the water of the
fountains and the leafy shade of the orange-trees give delicious
coolness from the blazing heart of the sun, you will find the
untiring charm and dreamy peace of Oriental repose.&nbsp; You
will see the women of Cordova gathered around the great
<i>alm&icirc;da</i> fountain with their red-brown pitchers to
fill.&nbsp; You will hear them chattering, telling the news of
the day.&nbsp; Now and then <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>will come a sound of laughter as a
youth, also with a vessel to fill, joins them.&nbsp; The women
will leave their pitchers and go into the mosque, one by one or
in groups together, for prayer is a part of the day&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; Figures move slowly up and down the cloisters; they
are the Canons; each will be smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; Groups of
beggars crouch on the low stone seats; they seem quite content in
the sun.&nbsp; At the hour of service a band of acolytes will
come from the chancery and cross the court slowly to the mosque,
making a line of scarlet.&nbsp; And presently there will be a
soft sound of music as the boys sing the <i>coplas</i> in honour
of the Virgin.&nbsp; Yes, the Court of Oranges is the most
perfect spot in Cordova, to which the stranger will come again
and again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>And when you go into the mosque itself, you will pass out of
the colonnades of orange-trees into colonnades of stone.&nbsp;
Before you, around you, everywhere, a forest of columns; and the
canopy of curves above you, formed by the double rows of crossed
fantastic arches, <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>will seem like the interlacing branches of great
trees.&nbsp; You will remember those enchanted forests you
dreamed of as a child.&nbsp; In truth, the architecture of the
mosque is like a living thing.&nbsp; The light, entering from
above, plays upon the arches, causing the red stones to gleam
like fire; it frets the thousand columns with moving patterns; it
catches the glass mosaics in jewelled brilliance, and makes a
soft shining upon the marble pavement, in which, as you look up
and down, you see the long arcades reflected until the distance
dies away, mysterious and apparently unending.</p>

<p>But words cannot describe this wonderful temple.&nbsp; The
Moorish houses of prayer will bring you a sense of joy: there is
nothing of the mystic suggestion of a Gothic cathedral&mdash;that
of Seville, for instance; your spirit is freed, not awed.&nbsp;
The mosque was to the Moor this world as well as the next.&nbsp;
Here is the message of a race who understood the fulness of
living so well that they knew how to be joyously at home with
their God; and you realize more fully this lesson that the <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Moors gave
to Spain, which finds its expression to-day in the
Spaniard&rsquo;s happy familiarity with his God.</p>
<p>The stranger will now be ready to understand the special
atmosphere of Seville, for it is this frank acceptance of joy as
the gold thread of life which gives the southern city its
charm.&nbsp; It is not shadowed with memory like sleeping
Cordova, nor is it overburdened with heroic monuments like
Toledo; there are no ruins such as give sadness to Granada; it is
still a living city whose blood is pulsing with the joy of life
lived in the sunshine.</p>
<p>The buildings for which the city is famous all have this
aspect of joy&mdash;the Moorish Tower of Gold; the
Alc&aacute;zar, with its flower-crowded gardens; the Giralda
Tower, which is so old, and yet in its glittering whiteness looks
so new.&nbsp; There is a joyousness in these buildings that I
have never seen in the buildings of any other city.</p>
<p>Then, Seville is alive commercially, and from its wharves
among the orange-trees which line the banks of its rivers vessels
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>carry
away its wine, its oil, and its oranges.</p>
<p>Seville has no rival among the cities of Spain.&nbsp; The old
saying is still true: &ldquo;To him whom God loves He gives a
home in Seville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Seville you are happy without seeking to be so, and when
the stranger has learnt this he has learnt the secret of the
<i>Sevillanos</i>.</p>
<p>Seville has the aspect of a city given up to a holiday humour;
and if I wished to describe the special quality of her happy
people, I should say that they understood perfectly the difficult
art of loafing.&nbsp; You must be happy to loaf successfully;
that is why Northern people find it so difficult.&nbsp; But not
even the Venetians loaf as well as the <i>Sevillanos</i>.&nbsp;
Go to the Calle de las Sierpes, that narrow, animated street, the
centre of Seville&rsquo;s joyous life; it is different from other
streets; its gay shops, with the double row of irregular,
close-drawn windows that make a sinuous line of
light&mdash;certainly it is like a serpent.&nbsp; All day and far
into the night people saunter up and down its <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>pavements
or sit in one of the many <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, which are always
filled with crowds of unoccupied persons.&nbsp; You will seem to
be watching a stage play.&nbsp; It is here that you will see best
the <i>majos</i>, or dandies of Seville; in springtime there is
sure to be a <i>matador</i> strolling about in splendid costume,
and women in <i>mantillas</i> saunter to and fro with their slow,
graceful walk.</p>
<p>In the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> you will have an opportunity of
studying the typical Andalusian.&nbsp; He wears a short coat and
very tight trousers of a light colour, and a felt hat with a
broad, flat brim.&nbsp; He is always clean-shaven, and his hair
is cut very short.&nbsp; These men are often handsome, and have a
striking expression of strength; the faces, dignified and always
humorous, often resemble a comic actor.&nbsp; They are an
affectionate and friendly company, and their conversation echoes
with a deafening buzz.&nbsp; Notice the way in which they smoke
their cigarettes, and at intervals drink their <i>refrescos</i>
or sip from their small glasses of <i>aguardiente</i>.&nbsp;
Their enjoyment is <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>so Spanish, so epicurean.&nbsp; And women in the street
fan themselves in the same way.&nbsp; All these people are happy
in the frank acceptance of life as it is.</p>
<p>Inside the shops, which have doors wide open to the street,
groups of women sit to buy fans and <i>mantillas</i>.&nbsp;
Making purchases is a delightful game, in which all Spanish women
excel.&nbsp; They smile, and chatter, and use their fans,
bargaining with delicious grace, while the salesman, cigarette in
hand, shrugs his shoulders and gesticulates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the <i>mantilla</i> is dear,
se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He throws out his hands in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;orita; I am giving it away at ten
<i>pesetas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the quality good?&rdquo; and she raises her eyebrows
in bewitching incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as God&rsquo;s blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with mutual smiles and salutations the purchase is
made.</p>

<p>It is in the Paseo de las Delicias&mdash;the name will tell
you of the beauty of this park, with its orange-groves, hedges of
blue aloes, <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>and all manner of tropical trees and flowers&mdash;that
the ladies of Seville drive and promenade each afternoon.&nbsp;
The <i>majos</i> cast languishing glances upon them as they walk
to and fro, and compliments are given: &ldquo;Oh, Jesus, what an
air!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Happy is the mother that bore
thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your eyes are as runaway stars that
would rather shine in your face than in the heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Sevillanas</i> smile and chatter together; this play of
love is a part of the accustomed homage which is their due.</p>
<p>There is a fascination about Spanish women not easy to
define.&nbsp; Many of them are not beautiful, but they are always
graceful, and they all walk beautifully.&nbsp; Then, most of them
have the soft, expressive eyes which the East has bequeathed to
Spain.&nbsp; There is a quality and certain finish about them
which is unique; each one looks as if she understood that she was
a woman, and was very glad that this was so.&nbsp; Perhaps this
is why they are so attractive; this is the reason, too, why the
old women are so <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>good-humoured, smiling, and gay.&nbsp; The indefinite
unquietness that so often characterizes English and American
women is entirely absent.&nbsp; These Spanish se&ntilde;oras, for
their happiness, have kept the pagan content.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Much of what is characteristic of the home life of the
Sevillians may be gathered from the arrangement of their
houses.&nbsp; They are all&mdash;the houses of the poor as well
as those of the rich citizens&mdash;built around the
<i>patio</i>, or shaded court, where palms, myrtles,
pomegranates, and jasmines grow, and the singing of caged birds
mingles with the sound of the playing fountains.&nbsp; Into this
<i>patio</i> all the windows of the house open and the rooms
lead.&nbsp; The doors are of open ironwork&mdash;no two doors are
alike&mdash;and often, even in the small houses, the grating is
of exquisite workmanship.&nbsp; One door, which also has an open
<i>reja</i>, or grating, leads into the street.&nbsp; It is in
these <i>patios</i> that the Sevillians spend their lives, and
this throwing open of their homes to the gaze of all who pass in
the streets is exactly characteristic of this simple, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>happy
people.&nbsp; Every afternoon and evening the youth of the family
laugh and sing and dance to the rattle of the castanets.&nbsp; It
is against the <i>rejas</i> that the lovers stand at night and
sing their serenades, and so persistent is their patience that
they have gained the title of &ldquo;iron-eaters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All Andalusians are musical; even the beggar thrums his guitar,
which he will not part with for bread; to him music is a
necessity, and bread a luxury with which he can dispense.</p>
<p>The Andalusian&rsquo;s leisure is a perpetual source of
delight.&nbsp; What impresses the serious foreigner, who is so
fortunate as to become an inmate of a Sevillian home, is the
mirth and courtesy of the family, who all seem to enjoy endless
leisure.&nbsp; Spanish households have a pleasantness quite their
own.&nbsp; The men are never preoccupied with business; smoking
cigarettes, they will pass hours chattering to the women of the
family, who spend the greater part of the day working their
beautiful embroideries.&nbsp; Few books are read, and talking is
the chief occupation.&nbsp; <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>No people can talk like the
Spaniards, and the excitement is so spontaneous that often the
conversation is carried on far into the night.&nbsp; The
slightest incident gains a poetic vividness from their dramatic
telling.&nbsp; Cigarette-smoking and talking are the only
indulgences which the Sevillians carry to excess.</p>
<p>In their home life there is a love of visiting and a love of
receiving visitors.&nbsp; <i>Tertulias</i>, or parties, are
frequent.&nbsp; But a Spanish party differs materially from an
English, in so far as there are no refreshments&mdash;if we
except the glasses of pure water and plate of <i>azucarillos</i>
to sweeten the water, which are placed upon a side-table.&nbsp;
This is an instance of the sobriety of the Sevillians.&nbsp; The
guests dance and sing and talk incessantly, and are perfectly
satisfied to enjoy themselves without eating.</p>
<p>The Spaniards are good hosts; the exquisite politeness which
is natural to them, even to those of the very lowest classes,
causes them to lay themselves out to <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>entertain; boredom would seem to be
unknown to the native host and hostess.&nbsp; They make a
pleasure of the slightest social intercourse.&nbsp; I recall one
occasion in Seville, when I asked permission to enter the house
of a poor woman in the Macarena quarter, in order that my artist
friend might make a drawing from her balcony of a building of
which a satisfactory view could not be obtained in the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My house is yours, se&ntilde;oras; make whatsoever use
of it you will,&rdquo; was her answer to my request.&nbsp; And
during the hours that my friend was at work she put aside her
occupations&mdash;she was a <i>planchadora</i>, and was ironing
with her assistants on our entrance&mdash;and gave herself up
solely to help and entertain us.&nbsp; A <i>refresco</i> was
brought to us; <i>calientes</i>, the twisted doughnuts which are
made in every Andalusian house, were fried for us.&nbsp; Nor
would she consent to receive the payment which we, with our
foreign stupidity, offered to her on our departure.&nbsp; No, the
kindly, cheery <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>woman did not understand payment for hospitality.</p>
<p>But it is during the days of festival at Easter and the
<i>Feria</i> that the fine hospitality of the Sevillians is seen
at its best.&nbsp; The houses are filled to overflowing, and
hospitality is taxed to a degree that only the most perfect
courtesy and good-nature could endure.&nbsp; Every corner is
received with a chorus of welcome, and embraced like a
brother.&nbsp; Beds are surrendered, even sofas are given up, and
as fresh strangers arrive, unable to gain accommodation in the
crowded inns, mattresses, pillows, and rugs are brought out of
cupboards, and beds are made upon the floor.&nbsp; All the
members of the family, and even the tired servants, who are
always joyously ready to help, sit up, because there is literally
<i>nowhere</i> for them to sleep.&nbsp; The difficulty of
obtaining provisions in these seasons of festivity is very great:
the butcher cannot provide meat; even bread is hard to buy.&nbsp;
But the se&ntilde;ora of the house is never troubled; she tells
you her woes, and then <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>goes smiling to fry <i>calientes</i>
and prepare other delicacies for the refreshment of her
guests.&nbsp; The constant Spanish courtesy never fails, and the
foreigner who happily chances among this crowded joyous party can
but wonder.</p>

130</span>CHAPTER IV&mdash;TOWN LIFE IN SPAIN
(<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Madrid: its Situation&mdash;The Old
Town&mdash;The Rastro&mdash;The New Town&mdash;The Puerta del
Sol&mdash;<i>Caf&eacute;s</i>&mdash;The
<i>Aguadores</i>&mdash;The Prado Park&mdash;The
Theatre&mdash;Spanish Children&mdash;The Museums&mdash;The
Picture-galleries.</p>
<p>The contrast is great from Seville to Madrid, which is less
distinctly Spanish than any city in the Peninsula.&nbsp; The
royal capital, established by the decree of Philip II., has the
appearance of an accidental growth on the harsh Castilian
slopes.&nbsp; The climate is the worst of any town in
Spain.&nbsp; Madrid suffers all the oppressions of the
sky&mdash;baked by fierce summer suns, and chilled by the ice of
treacherous winds.&nbsp; In point of distance it is only some
twenty leagues, in one direction, from Toledo, and in the other
from beautiful <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>Avila; but in its life it is separated by centuries
from the old Spanish cities.&nbsp; It is the strangest
transformation to come from them into the eager, bustling life of
the modern capital.&nbsp; There are no antiquities here, no great
memories, no romance, nothing but what the people and the natural
brightness in the air give to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>To stay in Madrid is to undergo the most absorbing
fatigue.&nbsp; The Madrile&ntilde;o lives with a speed that in
Spain startles.&nbsp; The city never sleeps, never stays its
chatter; its inhabitants are apparently so full of business that
they turn day into night, yet no one seems to work.&nbsp; It thus
comes about that the lover of Spain, who has become used to the
untroubled content of happy Seville or the sleeping peace of
Cordova and Toledo, can with difficulty find himself at home in
Madrid.</p>
<p>Madrid is a city of contrasts.&nbsp; Treasures of art abound
in its museum, yet of all cities it is surely the least
influenced by the spirit of beauty and design.&nbsp; Its splendid
bridge which <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>gives entrance to the city has been ridiculed with the
question, &ldquo;Where is the river?&rdquo;&nbsp; It misses all
charm of environment; the city has no suburbs, and the country
around is barren and without trees and verdure.&nbsp; Yet the
Madrile&ntilde;os cannot be persuaded that any other city is its
equal.&nbsp; It is a capital in transition of a country in
transition, and as such it must be regarded.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p135.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Rastro Market, Madrid"
title=
"The Rastro Market, Madrid"
src="images/p135.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The old part of the town, such as the Rastro and surrounding
narrow streets, where on each Sunday is held the market, the
largest rag-fair in the world, still bring one a sensation of
living in the Middle Ages.&nbsp; The wares are laid out in most
primitive fashion in the narrow streets in great piles; all kinds
of antiquities are sold, as well as clothes and wonderful peasant
jewellery.&nbsp; The low stalls are piled up with flowers,
fruits, and vegetables, of all colours, in confused
abundance.&nbsp; Women and girls stand in groups of twos or
threes, or sit beside their wares, bundled in bright-coloured
shawls, and all with kerchiefed heads.&nbsp; They talk
incessantly; they do not <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>seem to care whether their goods are
sold or not, but they chaffer noisily over every sale.&nbsp; Some
of the women have perfectly-shaped faces with magnetic eyes that
recall the East.&nbsp; It was here once that I saw a
<i>manola</i>, beautifully attired with a white <i>mantilla</i>,
silk shoes, gaily coloured dress and jewellery.&nbsp; She
reminded me of Goya&rsquo;s pictures.</p>
<p>Fine savage old men in tattered cloaks wander on the outskirts
of the market asking alms, and beautiful, bewitching children
play their games unchecked.</p>
<p>But the Rastro is not the real Madrid.&nbsp; The modern town,
with its aspect of a city still in the making, so that one thinks
not so much of what it is as of what it may become, has grown up
in the image of Paris, with boulevards, wide streets, tall
characterless houses and modish shops.&nbsp; It is to be feared
that this new Madrid will overgrow all that is left of the old
city.</p>
<p>The Madrile&ntilde;os spend their lives in the streets and
squares, almost all of which are wide, clean, and well
paved.&nbsp; The houses are <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>ornamented with balconies, the first
of which, supported by pillars, forms in many parts of the city a
piazza where the inhabitants may walk under cover.&nbsp; The
Puerta del Sol, the largest and most animated <i>plaza</i>, and
the centre of Madrid, is the rendezvous of the idlers of the
city.&nbsp; From eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and far into
the night, it is thronged with groups of men wrapped in their
cloaks, which they wear to protect them from the treacherous
winds that sweep the city even in summer.&nbsp; Furnished with
several dozen cigarettes and coppers for <i>az&uacute;car</i> and
water, they pass the hours in endless talking.&nbsp; Politics
form the chief subject of conversation, and the progressive
element in Spanish society discusses here.</p>
<p>Most of the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> are in this quarter, and they
are always filled.&nbsp; They are less attractive in their
outside appearance than the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> of Seville, but
the refreshments served are excellent.&nbsp; The
Madrile&ntilde;os, like all Spaniards, drink more water than
wine.&nbsp; In every street and <i>paseo</i> you see the <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>picturesque
<i>aguadore</i>, with his <i>c&aacute;ntaro</i> of white or brown
clay and reed basket, containing glasses, sticks of
<i>azucarillos</i>, and oranges or limes.&nbsp; He has not
changed from the day when Velazquez painted him; he still wears a
loose jacket of snuff-coloured cloth, breeches, leather gaiters,
and a peaked hat.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the climate which causes the Madrile&ntilde;os
always to suffer thirst.&nbsp; The <i>bebidas heladas</i>, or
iced drinks, flavoured with orange, lemon, strawberry, cherries,
or almond, which are sold in every <i>caf&eacute;</i>, are far
superior to any English or American beverages.&nbsp; Spanish
preserves also deserve to be mentioned, and there is one variety,
known by the name &ldquo;angel&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo; <i>cabello de
angel</i>, which is delicious.</p>
<p>Madrid is so much a modern city that at first the stranger
hardly realizes how pleasantly its inhabitants live.&nbsp; It is
most fortunately rich in well-shaded parks and beautiful green
promenades.</p>
<p>The Prado is the evening gathering-place of the fashionable
Madrile&ntilde;os, and the <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>tree-shaded promenade, from seven
o&rsquo;clock onwards, affords the most animated sight.&nbsp; An
astonishing number of people collect here.&nbsp; In the crossways
which intersect the carriage-drive, all the families of the city
walk to enjoy the cool of the evening.&nbsp; The
Madrile&ntilde;os are seen at their finest here.&nbsp; The
<i>majos</i>, resembling plates of fashion in their tight,
faultless clothes, stand about in groups admiring the ladies who
roll past in landaus, for carriages are essential to fashionable
Madrid.&nbsp; Some of the men ride the splendid Andalusian
horses; with manes, long sweeping tails, and gay trappings, like
the horses that Velazquez painted.&nbsp; The Madrile&ntilde;as
have adopted the costumes of Paris, and in fashionable attire
Spanish women always look badly dressed.&nbsp; The
<i>mantilla</i> is, however, worn by most women, and even a plain
face looks beautiful in this fascinating head-dress.&nbsp; Like
all Spanish women, each Madrile&ntilde;a carries a fan, which is
held open as a parasol to give shade from the sun.&nbsp; A woman
without a fan is unknown, and there is something truly <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Spanish in
the use these vivid, bewitching women make of them.&nbsp; The
Madrile&ntilde;a collects fans as an English lady collects
jewels; she will often own more than a hundred of various colours
and patterns.</p>

</a></p>
<p>During summer this outdoor parade in the Prado is in gay
career until midnight; and as the night advances the promenades
are full of gay noise.&nbsp; There are open-air concerts, and
dancing takes place upon the open spaces of grass.&nbsp; Around
the stalls of the <i>refresco</i> sellers, families are seated
talking gaily together.&nbsp; The greatest animation
prevails.&nbsp; The Madrile&ntilde;os never seem to be
tired.&nbsp; The abandonment to happiness is contagious, and the
stranger will gain a sense of the joy of life as he sees the
ardent faces of men, women, and children, in whom mirth is never
vulgar, but as natural as speech.</p>
<p>In the winter season the Madrile&ntilde;os visit the theatre,
which every Spaniard adores.&nbsp; Gautier writes that
&ldquo;long before Shakespeare the Spaniards invented the
drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>produced an almost countless number of dramatic works,
and a passion for the drama still animates the people.&nbsp;
Spanish women, as we should expect, are first-rate actresses;
they mark all shades of character with appreciation and fine
delicacy.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that it was in Spain
that women first played women&rsquo;s parts, which in England at
the same period were entrusted to boys.</p>
<p>The Teatro Real at Madrid is devoted to Italian opera, but at
the more popular Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol, where La Guerrero, the
Bernhardt of Spain holds sway, there is an opportunity of
witnessing the native dramas of Zorilla, Hartzenbusch, and Tirso
de Molina, or the modern society plays of Echegaray and
Galdos.&nbsp; The <i>sainete</i>, which takes the place of our
&ldquo;curtain-raiser,&rdquo; is usually comic, and those that
are most popular are adapted from the farces of Cervantes and
Lope de Rueda.</p>
<p>Even in the heat of summer the Madrile&ntilde;os visit the
theatres, but at this season the <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>performances are limited to the
popular <i>zarzuelas</i>, operettas, four of which are given in
each evening.</p>
<p>Spanish children share the love of the theatre which belongs
to their elders.&nbsp; At the afternoon performances, which are
given on every Sunday and <i>fiestas</i>, half the house is
occupied by child ticket-holders, whose interest in the action of
the piece is astonishing.&nbsp; They applaud with cries of
&ldquo;<i>bonito</i>&rdquo;; they ask questions, and the house is
never still for a single instant.</p>
<p>Spanish children are already grown up when quite young, but
they are the most fascinating little people, at the same time
natural and self-conscious, with a sort of precocious
winsomeness.&nbsp; Their bodies are so full of energy that they
give an impression of more vivid life than the children of
Northern countries.</p>
<p>Nowhere are children happier and more loved than in Spain; the
<i>ni&ntilde;os</i> are the idols of their parents, and are
universally treated with indulgence.&nbsp; Yet the Spanish child
is <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>not
spoilt, and the obedient spirit is never lacking.&nbsp; Even the
poorest child is taught to practise those courtesies of life
which in Spain are never forgotten.&nbsp; Ask a child his name,
and after the answer he will always add, &ldquo;at the service of
God and yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; No child forgets the &ldquo;<i>mil
gracias</i>&rdquo; with which a benefit is accepted.&nbsp; I
recall a small boy of peasant parentage who acted as my guide
upon one occasion, and who, when asked what gift he would like
for his service, answered: &ldquo;I shall like best,
se&ntilde;ora, what pleases you most to give me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even in the prayer which Spanish children offer at night you find
an expression of this quaint, delicious politeness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Joseph, Mary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your little servant keep,<br />
While, <i>with your kind permission</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay me down to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have taught Spanish children all praise their
intelligence.&nbsp; During the first twelve years of life both
girls and boys develop more rapidly than other European
children.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>This
precocious understanding is manifest in their games.&nbsp; Go to
the great park of the Buen Retiro, where during each afternoon
the young Madrile&ntilde;os are busy with their plays of
bull-fighting, politics, and flirtations.&nbsp; The children are
attended by their nurses, who most frequently are the
<i>pasiegas</i> from Santander, who wear the charming national
costumes of a pleated red petticoat with silver-lace border,
velvet bodice, and brightly coloured handkerchief as
head-dress.</p>
<p><i>Al toro</i> is the favourite game.&nbsp; The
<i>ni&ntilde;os</i>, using a mask for the bull and the capes of
red and yellow which are sold on the stalls, go through the whole
pantomime of the bull-ring with a vivid and quite grown-up
delight in the sharp appeal made to their sensations.&nbsp;
Another group play at soldiers, armed with sticks for swords and
holding a great flag.&nbsp; Other children, a little older, pass
the time in flirtations.&nbsp; The boys pay the extravagant
Spanish compliments to little girls, or in the wooded groves they
sing the native melodies to the answering songs of the
nightingales.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>I
talked with one young singer, who told me he had reached his
fifteenth year, and already was betrothed.&nbsp; I asked him if
he were not too young.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; was
his answer; &ldquo;God is good, and my parents have money to
maintain us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards he took up his song, that
had something wild and Oriental in its passionate notes.</p>
<p>Among the excellences of Madrid must be counted her
Museums.&nbsp; The Armeria with its fine collection of arms and
weapons, the Museo Naval, and the Museo Arqueologico, furnish
effective mementoes of the entire tragedy of Spain&rsquo;s
history.&nbsp; Of her art galleries who can say praise
enough?&nbsp; It is only in Madrid that it is possible to
realize, to the full extent of their gifts and limitations, the
artists of Spain.&nbsp; The Academia de Bellas Artes and the
Museo de Arte Moderno are rich in pictures.&nbsp; And it is to
see the Museo del Prado that the stranger visits Madrid; no
picture-gallery in the world contains a more wonderful collection
of masterpieces.</p>
<p>It is a splendid art inheritance that is <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>enshrined
in the Prado.&nbsp; Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries was closely connected with the countries that were then
the centres of art.&nbsp; The Catholic Sovereigns had a fine
taste for pictures, and to them we owe largely the collection of
the great works which, after the pictures of Velazquez, are the
glory of the Prado.</p>
<p>The building, of pale brick and white stone, placed in a
tree-shaded park, is well designed, and on the whole well
lighted.&nbsp; Externally it is a model of what a picture-gallery
should be.&nbsp; A bronze statue of Velazquez stands before the
entrance.&nbsp; This is fitting.&nbsp; The Prado is in a very
special way the home of Velazquez.&nbsp; No other nation has been
so supremely fortunate in preserving almost intact the work of
her greatest painter.&nbsp; No picture is wanting to the complete
understanding of his exquisite art.</p>
<p>In the Prado there are masterpieces by the world&rsquo;s great
painters&mdash;by Titian, by Rubens, by Raphael, by Albrecht
D&uuml;rer, by Holbein, and how many others?&nbsp; But <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>even in the
presence of these masters we seek Velazquez.&nbsp; Here, too,
Goya astonishes us with his vigorous and wonderful art; there are
admirable paintings by El Greco, by Ribera, by Murillo; but we
can see nothing but Velazquez.&nbsp; And the emotion of first
seeing these pictures is one of awe.&nbsp; We are not in the
presence of an Old Master, but of a painter who in his perfect
art forestalled every modern movement in painting.&nbsp; This is
why Velazquez stands alone among artists.&nbsp; And the lover of
art journeys to the Prado that he may study his pictures, as the
pilgrim journeys to the shrine of his saint.</p>

153</span>CHAPTER V&mdash;COUNTRY LIFE IN SPAIN</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Life in a Spanish <i>Posada</i>&mdash;Spanish
Peasants&mdash;The Toilers of the Field and other
Workers&mdash;The <i>Cigarreras</i> of Seville&mdash;The
<i>Kermesse</i> in the Esclava Gardens&mdash;The Love of
Festivals&mdash;Easter Day in a Spanish Village&mdash;Third-class
Travelling&mdash;Wild Life in Spain&mdash;Fishing in the Country
Districts.</p>
<p>To know Spain it is not enough to visit the towns.&nbsp; It is
when the stranger leaves the beaten tracks of travel, and goes to
the country districts, where the outcome of modern progress is
still unknown, that he sees the life of ancient Spain almost
unchanged.&nbsp; I know of no experience more necessary to the
understanding of the country and its people than a lengthened
stay in a village <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; The life, indeed, will be
hard in many ways, and it will be wise for <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>the
stranger to cultivate the stoicism and indifference to personal
comfort that characterize the Spaniards themselves; but the
experience is excellent, and the people you meet are charming in
their kindness and perfect courtesy.</p>
<p>The <i>posada</i> is the <i>casa hu&eacute;spedes</i>, or
house of hospitality for the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The title is no
misnomer, but stands for what the village <i>posada</i> truly
is.&nbsp; To stay there is to find a new meaning in the word
&ldquo;hospitality&rdquo;; it is to know willing service,
restrained by the fine Spanish courtesy from offensive
attention.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p155.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>It is more than probable that the first sight of the
<i>posada</i> may disturb the stranger.&nbsp; It is built with a
spacious vestibule.&nbsp; On one side of the stone staircase,
which gives entrance to the upstairs living-rooms, is a dark
wineshop, where the men of the village foregather to talk and
drink the black native wine; while the other side serves as the
stable, in which the mules, donkeys, oxen, and other animals
belonging to the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>house, have their home.&nbsp; Many odours cling about
the dark staircase; the scent of closely packed animals mingles
with that of garlic, while the air reeks with the fumes of rancid
<i>aceite</i>, or oil&mdash;the never-to-be-forgotten smell that
belongs to every <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; The noise in the vestibule
is deafening and incessant; the men talk in loud voices which are
piercingly vibrant and metallic.&nbsp; Cackling hens, with maybe
a fat black pig or little woolly lamb, block the way as one
climbs the staircase to the living-room.</p>
<p>This room is bare, but never dirty; the filth which I had been
led to expect from my experience of some of the smaller inns in
the towns does not exist in the village <i>posadas</i>.&nbsp; The
large windows open on to wooden balconies which look out on to
the tree-shaded <i>plaza</i>.&nbsp; The walls are freshly
whitewashed, and the bare boards of the floor are scrubbed to
snowy whiteness by their daily scouring with sand; the curtains,
too, when there are any, are always white.&nbsp; Sometimes a few
highly coloured and amazing religious <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>prints in black frames hang upon the
walls, but, fortunately, more often they are bare.&nbsp; The
furniture is of the simplest description&mdash;a large table,
bare of any cloth, that fills most of the room, wooden chairs and
a Spanish press, a great cupboard which holds the linen of the
family.&nbsp; The beds are placed in small alcoves which lead out
of the living-rooms; and these beds are always comfortable, with
spotless linen, embroidered, lace-trimmed, and brought from the
lavender-scented chest.&nbsp; There is no fireplace in the
living-room, and if, as often chances in winter and early spring,
the weather is cold, the only heat is gained from the
<i>brasero</i>, whose charcoal ashes give the very faintest glow
of warmth.&nbsp; The Spaniards accept cold without murmur; they
wrap themselves in their cloaks, and wait till God sends out the
sun.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The <i>posada</i> is ruled by the se&ntilde;ora.&nbsp; She
sways a rod of iron over her husband, relatives, servants,
guests, and the arrangements of the house, being full of energy
and the vigour of character that is common to <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Spanish
women even in old age.&nbsp; She is the characteristic type of
the Spanish woman of the people, her face a formidable mass of
wrinkles; <i>jamona</i>, or stout in body, but of surprising
agility; she is witty, smiling, and contented.&nbsp; From break
of day until late evening she bustles about, shouting orders as
she goes from one task to another, yet she seems never hurried,
never overburdened.&nbsp; How happy she is if her efforts are
appreciated and her guests enjoy the fare she has provided! how
her face saddens and clouds if any dish is sent from the table
uneaten.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mas, mas!&rdquo; (More, more!), is her
constant cry as she enters the room at the beginning of every
course to urge her guests to eat.</p>
<p>To have English visitors staying at her posada filled the good
se&ntilde;ora with pride.&nbsp; Her satisfaction reached its
zenith when letters arrived from England.&nbsp; She was loath to
yield them up.&nbsp; &ldquo;The great English people will know of
my <i>posada</i> now,&rdquo; she said on one occasion, pointing
to the address in triumph.&nbsp; With comical humility she <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>asked that,
in my goodness, I would give her the envelope.&nbsp; How well do
I remember the joy with which she carried away the torn
trophy!</p>
<p>Nothing was too good for these strangers who had come from a
foreign land to stay at her <i>posada</i>.&nbsp; The best of
everything the house contained was given up for our use, special
food was cooked, and the village was ransacked to provide things
fitting for <i>los Ingl&eacute;ses</i>.&nbsp; On one occasion,
when I had asked for a certain food not to be obtained in the
neighbourhood, a messenger was sent on horseback twenty miles
over the mountains to the nearest town to procure it.&nbsp; Nor
was any payment allowed for the service.&nbsp; No, the English
se&ntilde;ora was her guest; she had asked for something, it was
her duty to provide it.&nbsp; The trouble! the expense! she did
not understand.&nbsp; In the old Spain service is not rendered
for payment.</p>
<p>It is in the villages that one is best able to study the
peasants and the gipsies.&nbsp; Sunday is the <i>dia festivo</i>,
when the youths and maidens, dressed in the picturesque native <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>costumes,
dance and sing to the music of the village piper, who plays the
<i>dulzaina</i>, a kind of clarionet.&nbsp; He marks the time by
beating on a drum which is slung around his waist.&nbsp; The
singing is the tuneless chanting heard so often in Spain, a kind
of interminable dwelling on one piercing note, not beautiful to
unaccustomed ears, but disturbing in its strange appeal, which so
persistently recalls the East.&nbsp; The dances are danced by
boys and girls and men and women grouped in couples of four or
six.&nbsp; There is a great deal of movement; the hands keep time
with the feet, playing castanets hung with bright-coloured
ribbons.</p>
<p>In all parts of Spain there are gipsies, but it is in the
districts of the south that the stranger will see them best, for
there would seem to be a special affinity between the Andalusian
and the gipsy character.&nbsp; The Gitanas and Gitanos live in
communities, often in houses carved out of the mountain
sides.&nbsp; It is among them that we find the most typical of
the Spanish dancers.&nbsp; Dancing <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>is a universal accomplishment, a
part of life, in which every girl and boy takes his or her
share.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On one day in the week the market is held in every small town,
on the open ground of the <i>plaza</i>, under the overspreading
trees.&nbsp; Let us look at the market-place at Ampuero, a large
village in the Basque province of Guip&uacute;zcoa.&nbsp; The
whole ground space is filled with booths that are piled up with
fruit and vegetables, with dress-stuffs, pots, water-jugs,
furniture, and a medley of wares that give bright colour to the
scene.&nbsp; Peasants from the surrounding hamlets have all come
to buy and sell.&nbsp; They are dressed in the native
costume&mdash;the men with the <i>boina</i>, or cap of dark blue
wool, shaped like a Scotch tam-o&rsquo;-shanter, short smock
jackets, trousers of bright blue linen, and red or black body
sashes; and the women with their many-coloured handkerchiefs of
silk, bright skirts that are short and very wide, and still
brighter blouses.&nbsp; The Spanish peasants have the delight in
vivid colour that belongs to all <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>primitive and happy people.</p>
<p>The sellers and buyers stand about in groups talking in the
ancient and mysterious Basque language, which once, as
place-names prove, was spoken over the greater part of the
Peninsula.&nbsp; All business is carried out in the vivid,
primitive Spanish manner.&nbsp; And what impresses the stranger
most is the courtesy and happy good-nature, which makes the
universal bargaining a game enjoyed alike by buyer and
seller.</p>
<p>In one corner of the <i>plaza</i>, under an archway, is a
stone image, beneath which burns a sacred lamp, and always, as
they pass, the men and women pause, cross themselves, and make a
genuflection; religion is part of business.&nbsp; The mules and
ox-carts stand at the outskirts of the plaza.&nbsp; The mules are
shaved on the upper part of their bodies and their tails and
ears, and have a curious appearance; they are thin and badly
cared for, but this is hidden by their gay trappings.&nbsp; The
ox-waggons are exceedingly primitive, and as each one arrives a
hoarse and deafening noise pierces the air.&nbsp; The peasants
leave <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>the wheels of the cart unoiled, and delight in the
frightful music, which can be heard half a league away; they
believe that the sound drives off demons.&nbsp; A peasant would
not own a cart that did not &ldquo;play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Basques claim to be the oldest race in Europe; and it is
now generally acknowledged that they represent the primitive
Iberians of Berber stock, who form the fundamental population of
all Spain.&nbsp; Many primitive customs survive among them, and
one of the most interesting is that by which the eldest daughter
in some districts takes precedence over the sons in
inheritance.&nbsp; They are a people of the mountains, and to
know the Basques you must live in their villages; even their one
town, Bilbao, in spite of its industrial and commercial
prosperity, is really an overgrown village more than a
city.&nbsp; It offers a striking contrast to Barcelona, the other
great Spanish seaport, and the most perfect example of a
commercial city.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To see the Basques at their finest you <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>must watch
them in the fields, where the women work side by side with the
men, and appear to have equal strength with them.&nbsp; They use
a large and primitively-shaped fork on which both feet are placed
to force the implement into the ground, and the work is carried
out with surprising rapidity.</p>
<p>Great flocks of sheep are reared in Spain, especially in
Estremadura; each flock belonging to one proprietor is called a
<i>caba&ntilde;a</i>, and many contain 50,000 sheep.&nbsp; The
shepherd who guards the <i>caba&ntilde;a</i> is one of the most
constant figures in the country districts.&nbsp; A million
arrobes of wool&mdash;an arrobe is about 25 pounds&mdash;are said
to be obtained in each year, and the wool is famed throughout
Europe.&nbsp; Although manufactures are not extensively
developed, I have seen cloth made at Guadalajara that for beauty
of colour and quality would compare favourably with the
manufactures of England or France.&nbsp; It is worth noting that
in some manufactories it is the custom to set aside a portion of
the wool to be sold for the benefit of souls in <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>purgatory&mdash;an instance of how in Spain religion is
connected with everything.</p>
<p>The most important industries of Spain are wine-making and
fruit-growing.&nbsp; The country makes all the common wines for
her own consumption, and the brandies, rich wines, and fruits
exported form a considerable source of wealth.&nbsp; Many
thousands of men, women, and children, are employed in these
industries.&nbsp; At Seville and other towns in the south, the
women pick the oranges ready to be taken to the ships.&nbsp;
Great heaps of golden fruit line the groves, which are afterwards
sorted, the better fruit being wrapped in paper before it is
packed.</p>
<p>One of the oldest industries is pottery.&nbsp; The
<i>jarro</i>, or earthen pots used for water, are made of white
or red clay, unglazed, and very beautiful in shape.&nbsp; The
<i>jarro</i> are sold by women in the markets of the towns for a
few reales&mdash;that is to say, about five or six English
pence.</p>

<p>Spanish workers are universally poor, receiving wages so low
that it is surprising <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>how they live.&nbsp; But they are
thrifty and sober, while their needs are simple, and their
hardships are mitigated in some measure by the fact that almost
all industries are carried on out of doors.&nbsp; In the streets
of the towns you see men and women at work at the edge of
pavements, making and mending boots, working sewing-machines,
preparing leather goods, ironware, and other commodities.&nbsp;
The shops and small manufactories are open to the street; you can
see the occupants within making ropes and baskets, saddlebags,
brushes, and a variety of wares.&nbsp; What impressed me was that
these workers always looked happy.</p>
<p>Women play an important part in the life of workaday Spain,
and the splendid types of these women workers make the foreigner
think deeply.&nbsp; They are full of energy and vigour even in
old age.&nbsp; They work as well as the men in the fields,
turning the soil with forks, training the vines, and garnering
the grapes and chestnuts.&nbsp; I have seen women carrying
immense burdens, <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>unloading boats, acting as porters, removing household
furniture.&nbsp; I saw one woman with a chest of drawers easily
poised upon her head; another, who was quite old, carried a
bedstead.&nbsp; A beautiful woman porter in one village carried
our heavy luggage, running with it on bare feet, without sign of
effort.&nbsp; For what surprised me most was that, in spite of
hard physical labour, these women are beautiful.&nbsp; They are
always happy and contented; in their faces, and especially in
their eyes, is that indescribable expression, the wonderful smile
of Spanish women.</p>

will show the stranger a charming scene of labour.&nbsp; The
rooms of the factory are large, and, although low, are
airy.&nbsp; They open into outer courts, and the great chambers,
supported by pillars, resemble a church.&nbsp; Each room has its
altar, which is decorated with flowers and offerings.&nbsp; As
the workers pass they cross themselves, and never fail to make
the customary <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>genuflection.&nbsp; Yet, with the easy familiarity
which is the special feature of the Spaniard&rsquo;s religion,
they will often place their outer garments upon the altar.&nbsp;
The <i>cigarreras</i> are deeply religious, and at a recent
Easter festival one of the <i>pasos</i> of the Virgin was
presented with a splendid new mantle at a cost of 9,000 dollars,
for the purchase of which the 7,000 workers had each contributed
two <i>centimos</i> a week during the preceding year.</p>
<p>The <i>cigarreras</i>, in brightly coloured costumes, sit at
work making <i>polvo de Sevilla</i> and <i>tabaco de
fraile</i>.&nbsp; A skilful worker can easily accomplish ten
<i>atados</i>, or bundles of fifty cigars, daily.&nbsp; The
murmur of conversation never ceases; talking seems to aid the
Spaniards in work.&nbsp; Many of the women have their babies with
them, whom they tend in the intervals of work; children a little
older play happily together in groups.&nbsp; It is enough to have
seen these smiling, contented, industrious women to know that
life is happy to most women in Spain.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>The
<i>Kermesse</i>, which is held each year in the Esclava Gardens,
is the festival of the <i>cigarreras</i>; it is a kind of
fair.&nbsp; The stalls and booths, where every variety of wares
are sold, are presided over by the <i>cigarreras</i>, dressed in
the beautiful Andalusian attire.&nbsp; They chaffer over every
sale, but they do not seek customers, and appear to be more
occupied in talking than in selling their goods.&nbsp; All day
long the gardens are full of gay noise.&nbsp; The women pass to
and fro; some sit on seats, some rest upon the grass under the
trees.&nbsp; In the centre of the gardens a platform is erected,
where in turn the women dance the <i>sevillanas</i> and other
dances with charming spontaneous enjoyment.&nbsp; The sound of
castanets and clapping of hands never ceases; the talking is
deafening.&nbsp; Sometimes there is a quarrel, but this is
rare.&nbsp; There is a natural refinement in these women, and
because they are really happy they have no need of riot to
convince themselves that life is pleasant.</p>

<p>Their love of festivals is shared by all <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Spaniards,
and everywhere holiday-making is a part of life.&nbsp; In the
country districts, as in the towns, the <i>Pascua de
Resurrecci&oacute;n</i> of Easter is the most popular festival,
when the days are spent in a curious combination of religious
ceremonial and holiday-making.</p>
<p>It was my good fortune to spend one Easter in a mountain
village, where I had an opportunity of seeing the customs of the
people of old Spain.&nbsp; On Palm Sunday the village was filled
to overflowing with peasants, many of whom had travelled long
distances, riding on mules or driving in the wooden ox-carts,
from the hamlets among the mountains.&nbsp; They were dressed in
the native costumes.&nbsp; The men wore velvet breeches adorned
with silver buttons, and leather gaiters, open to show the
calves; bright sashes of red or yellow silk; jackets of brown
cloth, with embroidered cuffs and collars; blue or maroon cloaks,
brightly lined; and pointed hats, adorned with silver
tassels.&nbsp; The fantastic dress gave the scene an aspect more
African than European.&nbsp; <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>The women were not so gay, and were
almost universally attired in black; but the <i>mantilla</i> with
the white flower, which all wore, gave them an incomparable
grace.&nbsp; All day the streets were filled with bustle and
life.&nbsp; Vendors of palms were stationed in every corner
selling their wares, while boys ran to and fro among the crowds
with arms full of olive branches.</p>
<p>The great function was the procession, when the <i>pasos</i>
were carried through the streets after the celebration of
Mass.&nbsp; In the <i>plaza</i> a stand had been erected, and
every seat was filled; people crowded the pavements, and in the
balconies of every house men and women were closely packed.&nbsp;
The gendarmes of the little town walked first, marching gravely,
the representatives of law and order; then followed the children,
clad in white, and bearing the consecrated palms and olive
branches; while after them came the priests, dressed in robes
richly embroidered and trimmed with lace.&nbsp; Upon the
shoulders of hidden bearers was carried the litter, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>illuminated
with hundreds of candles, upon which rested the figure of the
Virgin, the patron saint of the village.&nbsp; The image was
hideous, quite without beauty, and decked out in cheap tawdry
finery, strangely incongruous.&nbsp; But to the peasants she was
the Mother of God.&nbsp; I saw no sign of levity; the attitude of
the men as well as of the women was perfectly dignified,
perfectly religious.&nbsp; All eyes were riveted upon the sacred
figure, heads were bared, and each man and woman bowed and made
the sign of the cross as the lighted litter passed.&nbsp; Prayers
were murmured and blessings invoked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy Mother,
cause the crops to ripen,&rdquo; &ldquo;the sick child to be
healed,&rdquo; &ldquo;the lover&rsquo;s heart to
soften&rdquo;&mdash;such were the cries of the women.&nbsp;
Children pressed forward, dodging unchecked among the gendarmes
and priests, clamouring for a blessing.&nbsp; One small
<i>ni&ntilde;a</i> knelt upon the pavement in front of the
<i>pasos</i>, holding up a white carnation in offering.&nbsp; A
priest stepped forward, took the flower, and placed it upon the
litter.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>To
the children of the village the Easter days brought special
enjoyment.&nbsp; The part they played in the festival was a
strange one, giving an example of the old-world customs that live
so persistently in Spain.&nbsp; On the <i>Viernes Santo</i>, or
Good Friday, each boy and girl went to church armed with a horn
and large wooden clapper, upon which strange instruments they
played to frighten the spirit of the traitor Judas Iscariot, who
betrayed Se&ntilde;or Dios, the name by which they quaintly
designate the Saviour.&nbsp; They blew and rattled with a will,
and the hideous, deafening noise mingled strangely with the music
of the Mass, for the evil spirit must not escape.&nbsp;
Incomprehensible survival of an old superstition, blending the
grotesque with the most sacred service of the Church&mdash;how
often the stranger is surprised in Spain!</p>

<p>The Spaniards are more friendly with one another than any
people that I know.&nbsp; The stranger will realize this
travelling in the third-class trains, as he must in the country
districts, where the expresses do not stop.&nbsp; <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>These
trains are known as <i>mixto</i>, and convey luggage as well as
passengers.&nbsp; The carriages are uncomfortable, and not always
clean, and the speed is very slow.&nbsp; Patience is a quality
that the visitor to Spain must cultivate.&nbsp; The train may
start before the advertised time; it may be an hour late.&nbsp;
No Spaniard is disturbed by such trifles.&nbsp; At the stations
there is always a crowd of people waiting.&nbsp; There is a kind
of fatalistic patience in their appearance; they seem not so much
to be waiting for a particular train, as hoping that presently a
train will come that will take them to their destination.&nbsp;
Even when the train arrives there is no hurrying; a start will
not be made until everyone is ready, for punctuality is a small
virtue compared with politeness.&nbsp; The long-drawn cry of
<i>A-a-gua fresco</i>! is always heard.&nbsp; Much time is
occupied, as everyone in the train seems to want to drink.</p>
<p>In the carriages the company talk together with excessive
volubility, and have the appearance of being members of one
family.&nbsp; <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>As soon as you enter questions will be asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
Franc&eacute;ses or Ingl&eacute;ses?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have
you come to visit their country?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
married, and is the se&ntilde;or who is with you your
husband?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How many children have
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
do you wear a hat, and not a <i>mantilla</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And how is it you have no earrings and no
fan?&rdquo;&nbsp; You will soon become accustomed to this
interrogation, which is made with no hint of familiarity, and is
the outcome of a friendliness that wishes to make the stranger at
home.</p>
<p>The natives seem to be without a thought of themselves, and
incapable of considering personal comfort.&nbsp; They will crowd
upon one seat of the carriage to give the English strangers more
room.&nbsp; If the weather is cold, they will insist upon giving
you their cloaks.&nbsp; They talk to you incessantly, explaining
to you the scenery and various places through which the train
passes, with delightful childish enthusiasm.&nbsp; They will
offer you everything in <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>their possession that you chance to
admire.</p>

<p>I remember saying to a little Spanish maid, &ldquo;What a
beautiful carnation in your hair!&rdquo;&nbsp; Off came the
flower.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is at your disposal,
se&ntilde;ora.&rdquo;&nbsp; I protested with the fitting answer:
&ldquo;A thousand thanks, but, no, I could not
accept.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the offer was quite sincere, and, in
spite of protest, the flower was fastened into my hair, amidst
the compliments and congratulations of every occupant of the
carriage.&nbsp; On another journey a fan and a beautiful peasant
brooch, which I rashly admired, were pressed upon me with the
same delightful politeness.</p>
<p>When meal-time arrives, each peasant brings out the
<i>alforja</i>, or embroidered wallet, which Sancho Panza kept so
well filled.&nbsp; A huge Spanish loaf is produced, and some of
the long thin garlic sausages.&nbsp; Slices of the bread are cut
to serve as plates.&nbsp; But before the meal is begun a hearty
<i>gusta</i> invites all the other occupants to share in the
feast.&nbsp; It is customary at this stage to refuse, and
&ldquo;Muchas gracias&rdquo; is <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>politely murmured.&nbsp; Soon the
black-leather wine-bottle is brought out of the wallet and a
packet of some kind of sweetmeat.&nbsp; Now is the time for
acceptance; the bottle is handed round for everyone to drink, and
small pieces of the sweetmeat are divided.&nbsp; It is a charming
experience, provided that you have acquired the skill to drink
from that curious long-spouted bottle of leather.&nbsp; And if
you fail, the Spaniards will enjoy the task of teaching you the
art.</p>
<p>But, indeed, there is no limit to the helpful friendliness of
these simple happy people.&nbsp; On one occasion a workman
abandoned his own journey, and, in spite of our protests, came
with us.&nbsp; When we arrived at our destination, he spent
several hours in assisting us to find suitable lodgings in the
village in which we had planned to stay, where there was no
regular house of hospitality.&nbsp; He introduced us to the
inhabitants of the place as his friends, and expended much energy
to insure our comfort.&nbsp; It is only when work is profitable
that the Spaniard is ever lazy.&nbsp; <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>He delights to expend an immense
amount of effort, which may not be considered useful, so long as
the work makes appeal to his Spanish love of romantic
effects.&nbsp; It is because this trait is so often overlooked by
the stranger, who too quickly condemns &ldquo;the lazy
Spaniards,&rdquo; that I recount this characteristic
incident.&nbsp; Our friend was genuinely surprised when we
offered payment for his services; there was a note of dignified
sorrow in the &ldquo;Muchas gracias&rdquo; of his refusal.&nbsp;
It had been a privilege to assist <i>los Ingl&eacute;ses</i>,
whom he admired.&nbsp; Had he not once visited our country?&nbsp;
We were a great people.&nbsp; He desired that we should think
well of his country.&nbsp; All he would accept was to share our
meal, after which he left us&mdash;I suppose, to continue his own
journey.</p>
<p>Among the mountains and in many country districts there are
still no railways.&nbsp; The stranger who travels here has to use
the diligences, which on certain days in the week run from the
nearest town to the outlying hamlets.&nbsp; The diligence is a
kind of <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>coach without springs.&nbsp; I know of no other
conveyance so uncomfortable, except the long car of
Ireland.&nbsp; It is drawn by a team of gaunt mules, usually six
in number, with gay harness, and each animal has jangling bells
around its neck.&nbsp; The driver wears a picturesque dress: a
brown jacket with coloured collar, a red sash and knee-breeches,
and a peaked hat adorned with tassels.&nbsp; He drives with a
tremendous amount of noise, stamping his feet, shouting, and
brandishing his whip.&nbsp; He beats incessantly the wretched
mules.&nbsp; The coach is kept at full gallop, and ascends and
descends the steep hills with a rapidity which is often alarming;
but accidents are rare, owing to the sure-footedness of the
mules.</p>

<p>It was when travelling in these mountainous districts that we
gained some knowledge of the wild animals of Spain.&nbsp; We were
often near to the haunts of boars, wolves, and deer.&nbsp; Bears
are common in many hilly districts, and that fine wild creature,
the ibex, ranges the peaks of the <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>higher mountains.&nbsp; Foxes are
plentiful everywhere, and the wild-cat is far from scarce.&nbsp;
The marten is often found, and otters live in most of the
rivers.</p>
<p>The swamps and ponds are filled with big green frogs, and
lizards of the same colour are common.&nbsp; The frogs are much
larger than the English frog, and their peculiar cry, a sort of
monotonous rumbling, is so loud that it can be heard a mile
away.&nbsp; The legs of these green frogs are a table delicacy
much esteemed in many districts.</p>
<p>In the country hamlets the stranger must be prepared to meet
discomfort.&nbsp; One of the trials will be hunger.&nbsp; In the
<i>fondas</i> of the Basque provinces and in the smaller towns
the fare is ample, and as a rule well cooked.&nbsp; But the
peasants of Central and Southern Spain are the most frugal
people, who subsist on a diet that would be refused by the
poorest workers in England.&nbsp; For the stranger the peasants
do their utmost, but the diet is limited to eggs, leathery, quite
tasteless beef, hard stale bread, and thin <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>wine.&nbsp;
The cooking is always indifferent.&nbsp; The first meal of the
day consists of a cup of chocolate or coffee, often without milk,
and a lump of dry bread.&nbsp; There is no butter, and no milk
except goat&rsquo;s milk, and, strange as it seems in this
fertile land, vegetables and fruit are always scarce in the
country villages.&nbsp; The universal dish is <i>garbanzos</i>, a
large dried pea, which is cooked with garlic as a flavour.</p>
<p>We spent several months fishing in these districts, and,
although sometimes we fared tolerably well, more often we had to
be content with indifferent and inadequate meals.&nbsp; But for
the sake of experience the stranger can endure discomfort with
fortitude.</p>

<p>There are numerous sport-giving rivers in all parts of Spain,
which possess all the qualities for the production of
fish-life.&nbsp; Such rivers as the Sil and Minho contain trout
as big as any in Europe.&nbsp; The fishing is free, except for a
licence costing about three shillings.&nbsp; There can be no
doubt that with proper cultivation these rivers might <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>become a
fisherman&rsquo;s paradise in the course of a few years.&nbsp;
But a complete revision of the <i>ley de pesca</i>&mdash;fishing
law&mdash;is necessary.&nbsp; Rivers are not stocked, and trout
hatcheries are almost unknown.&nbsp; The poacher is everywhere,
using snares, spears, and the deadly dynamite.&nbsp; Thousands of
small fish are scooped out of the small pools of the tributaries
with pole-nets during dry seasons.&nbsp; But, on the other hand,
Spain is, happily, almost free, except in the mining districts of
the north, from poisoned and contaminated waters.&nbsp; There are
thousands of miles of beautiful rivers with no factories, works,
or big cities within many leagues of their lengths.&nbsp; Then,
the fish in the Spanish rivers are splendidly prolific.&nbsp;
Trout teem in many rivers, where the deep pools baffle the
poachers, who devote their attention to the shallows and
tributaries.&nbsp; Salmon are found in many rivers; shad or
s&aacute;balos, escalos&mdash;a kind of cross between a chub and
a dace&mdash;barbel, bogas, and other coarse fish, and eels, are
plentiful.&nbsp; The barbel is different from <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>the barbel
of England, being a handsomer fish and not so coarse; it is more
golden in colour, and the scales are less thick.&nbsp; The
beautiful silvery s&aacute;balos are caught in sunk nets, whose
opening is concealed by a green bough which looks like
water-weed, and so deceives the travelling fish.&nbsp; The
s&aacute;balos will not rise to any bait.&nbsp; They vary from 4
pounds to 12 pounds in weight, and are an excellent fish to eat,
resembling the salmon.</p>
<p>In all parts of Spain there are native anglers.&nbsp; The
tackle they use is of the rudest description&mdash;a rod made of
maize stalks, with a hazel switch for the top, coarse casts, and
flies clumsy and big.&nbsp; But they are all keen, and many of
them are clever fishermen.&nbsp; At Materosa, a small hamlet on
the wild Sil, some leagues from the town of Ponferrada, the
peasants gain their living by fishing with the rod for trout,
which they send to the market at Madrid.</p>
<p>I recall Estanislao, a <i>chico</i> who fished with a great
bamboo rod, which he looked too small to handle.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>We
talked to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are also a fisherman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;ora; I have fished all my life, and my
father before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This <i>chico</i> was a good angler.&nbsp; Standing on a great
boulder, he cast with a loud swishing noise across the river,
letting his dozen flies swim on the rough water.&nbsp; At each
cast the weight of his great rod nearly threw him into the
whirling current.&nbsp; But he caught more fish than we did.</p>
<p>We offered him a present of some of our flies.&nbsp; He looked
at them and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muchas gracias, they are very pretty.&nbsp; But how can
I catch big trout with these little hooks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed till the tears ran down his face.&nbsp; But in a
minute he remembered the good manners in which every Spanish
child is trained.&nbsp; He added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mil gracias, se&ntilde;ora!&nbsp; Es favor que usted me
hace (A thousand thanks, se&ntilde;ora!&nbsp; It is a favour you
make me).&nbsp; <i>I will keep them as toys</i>!&rdquo;</p>

204</span>CHAPTER VI&mdash;SPANISH ART</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Spanish Art the Reflection of the Spanish
Temperament&mdash;The Great Buildings of Spain&mdash;Spanish
Gothic&mdash;Its Realistic Naturalness, its Massiveness and
Extravagance&mdash;The Churches, the Real Museums of Art
Treasures&mdash;Polychrome Sculpture&mdash;Spanish
Painting&mdash;Its Late Development&mdash;Its Special
Character&mdash;Its Strength, its Dramatic and Religious
Character.</p>
<p>To understand Spain you must know her architecture, her
sculpture, and her pictures.&nbsp; For in Spain, perhaps to a
greater extent than in any country, art is the reflection of the
life and temper of the people.&nbsp; And this is true although
the essential ideas of her art in building, in carving, and in
painting, have all been borrowed from other nations.&nbsp; It is
the distinctive Spanish gift to stamp with the <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>seal of her
own character all that she learns from without.</p>
<p>The first, as it has remained the strongest, expression in art
of this people was in building and in sculpture, which gave
opportunity for emphasis to their special dramatic
temperament.&nbsp; We must go back to Rome for another country
that has spoken in its buildings with the same overwhelming
force.</p>
<p>The cathedrals which arose in the period of the nation&rsquo;s
greatest prosperity were the chief point of attraction&mdash;the
theatre, the centre, of all life.&nbsp; They were built for the
honour of God, but also for the enjoyment of the people
themselves; religion was joyful, popular&mdash;democratic, one
might say.&nbsp; All the exuberant life garnered by Hispano-Arab
culture lives in the Spanish buildings.&nbsp; Here Roman,
Byzantine, and Arab art have passed, and also the Mudejar, the
Gothic, and the Renaissance&mdash;in fact, all the styles of
Europe.&nbsp; For this reason there is no native school of
architecture.&nbsp; Spain possesses few <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>pure
Gothic, Romanesque, or Renaissance buildings.</p>
<p>But it is just this complexity which gives to the Spanish
buildings their special character.&nbsp; The Spanish artists,
though they lacked creative genius, were no base imitators; they
sought to combine, and they gave to the temples they had to
construct that massive, strong, and exuberant spirit that was in
harmony with their own temperament.&nbsp; In such a cathedral,
for instance, as that of Burgos we find vigour and joyous
exuberance rather than reserve and beauty&mdash;a confused
richness that has a flavour of brutality almost.&nbsp; The sombre
Gothic can be traced in the older portions of the building, but
everywhere it has been seized upon by the restless fancy of later
workers.&nbsp; Spanish architecture is like the Spanish
manners.&nbsp; The Spaniard can use a floridity of expression
that would be ridiculous in England.</p>

<p>The carving and moulding of wood and stone and iron in the
fifteenth century had reached a high level of
accomplishment.&nbsp; <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>And although none of the
world&rsquo;s famous sculptors have been Spaniards, the amount of
strong and beautiful carvings to be found in every part of the
Peninsula is amazing; in no country can they be surpassed.&nbsp;
Every great church and cloister contains carvings in wood&mdash;a
material chosen by the Spaniards for the freedom and facility it
gave for expression&mdash;which are treasures of delight.&nbsp;
The immense and amazing retablos and the carved walnut-wood
choir-stalls which every great church contains cannot be matched
elsewhere.&nbsp; It is a pity that these characteristic works are
hardly known; they are the basis of all Spanish art.&nbsp; In no
country in Europe can be seen more wonderful carvings than on the
monumental tombs of such cathedrals as Toledo, Zamora, and
Leon.&nbsp; Again, the ironwork church screens, notably those of
the cathedrals of Seville, Granada, and Toledo, cannot be
surpassed.&nbsp; In these works, with their dramatic conceptions,
finding expression in a wealth of interesting details, never
without the <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>tendency to over-emphasis of statement which marks the
art of this people, the Spanish character speaks.&nbsp;
&AElig;sthetic sensibility is almost always absent; the art here
is vigorous and romantic, frankly expressive, with a kind of
childlike, almost grotesque, naturalism that shows a realistic
grasp of all things, even of spiritual things.&nbsp; I recall the
polychrome sculpture of this people; the images of the anguished
Virgin, in which sorrow is carried to its utmost limit of
expression; the bleeding heads of martyred saints, such, for
instance, as those terrible yet moving heads of the Baptist by
Alonso Cano at Granada, or the poignantly lifelike polychrome
carvings of the Crucified Christ by Monta&ntilde;es, Gregorio
Hernandez, Juni Juanes, and other sculptors, which are seen in
many churches, and which are carried in procession in the Easter
<i>pasos</i> at Seville and elsewhere, images in which all the
details of the Passion are emphasized with an emotional delight
in the presentment of pain.&nbsp; And when I think of these
images I understand the bull-fight.</p>

<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Until
the fifteenth century painting found no home in Spain.&nbsp;
Placed as she is almost midway between the art centres of
Flanders in the North and of Italy in the South, Spain has
geographically a position of equipoise between these conflicting
art influences.&nbsp; But this balance of influence was modified
by the bent of the Spanish character, and the true affinity of
Spain in art has always been with the Flemings.&nbsp; No one can
doubt this who has a knowledge of the Spanish Primitives.&nbsp;
The art of Spain is Northern in its literalness, in its dramatic
force, and deep and singular gravity.</p>
<p>Jan van Eyck in 1428 visited Portugal and Spain, and, incited
by the brilliant reception accorded to the great Flemish master,
other enterprising Netherland painters flocked to the
Peninsula.&nbsp; From this time the native artists gave their
attention to painting, and on this Flemish foundation arose a
really capable group of painters.&nbsp; The essential ideas in
the pictures of these early masters are all borrowed; but, <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>though
Flemish in their inspiration, they yet retain an attractive
Spanish personality of their own.&nbsp; The Spanish painters,
more perhaps than the painters of any other school, have imitated
and absorbed the art of other nations without degenerating into
copyists.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But this development of a national art on the basis of Flemish
influence was not of long duration, and before the fifteenth
century closed the newly-born Spanish school was rudely disturbed
by the introduction into Spain of the Italian influences of the
Renaissance.&nbsp; The building of the Escorial brought a crowd
of artists from Italy&mdash;not the great masters, for they were
no longer alive, but pupils more or less mannered and
decadent.&nbsp; Spain was overrun with third-rate imitators of
the Italian grand styles, of Michael Angelo, of Raphael, and
their followers.&nbsp; This is not the place to speak of the
blight which fell upon the native painters.&nbsp; The distinctive
Italian schools were an influence for evil, fatal to <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the
expression of the true genius of the people; for the
deep-feeling, individualistic temper of the Spaniards could not
be reconciled with the spirit of Italy.</p>
<p>But the Spanish temper is strong.&nbsp; The native painters
used Renaissance forms, but they never worked in the Renaissance
spirit.&nbsp; And it was not long before Spanish artists were
turning to Venice, where they found a new inspiration in an art
suited to their temperament in its methods, and in its
spirit.&nbsp; El Greco, who had received his first inspiration
from Tintoretto, the mighty master of the counter-Reformation,
came as a liberating force to Spain.&nbsp; The torch he had
lighted at Tintoretto&rsquo;s fire burnt in Toledo with splendid
power.&nbsp; El Greco is the first great Spanish painter.</p>
<p>And the seventeenth century witnessed in the art of the
Spanish school one of those surprising outbursts of successful
life that meet us now and again, in every department of
enterprise, in this land of fascinating contradictions, which
give so strange a denial to <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>the usual limit of her
attainment.&nbsp; It was the century of Velazquez and Murillo, of
Ribera and Zurbaran.&nbsp; In Velazquez, Spanish painting gained
its crown of achievement.</p>
<p>In the period after his great inspiration, imitation seemed
inevitable to his successors.&nbsp; Spanish painting apparently
was dead.&nbsp; Yet it was just in this time of degradation that
the Spanish school was surprised suddenly by the remarkable art
of Goya.&nbsp; Again a great personality filled the Spanish art
stage, forcing a reversal of judgment.&nbsp; We forget the usual
level of the period&rsquo;s achievement; we remember only
Goya.&nbsp; With him, once more, we are face to face with a new
force in art.&nbsp; Spain challenges the world again; and she
gives it its most personal, its most daring genius.</p>
<p>Such, in briefest outlines, is the history of Spanish
painting.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It will be seen that Spain is not an art-lover&rsquo;s
paradise.&nbsp; There has never been a time when the
accomplishment of the Spanish school is really comparable to what
the Italian <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>and Flemish schools have achieved.&nbsp; Spain is not a
land of great painters.&nbsp; Murillo has sunk to the rank of a
second-rate master; Ribera and Zurbaran are yet hardly known
outside Spain.&nbsp; El Greco, Velazquez, Goya&mdash;these are
the only really great names; and Velazquez towers as much above
his fellow-artists as Cervantes above his fellow-novelists.&nbsp;
Spain&rsquo;s claim to the world&rsquo;s attention in the arts,
as also in literature, rests upon the accomplishment of
individuals more than upon the general average of her work.&nbsp;
It is the result of that personal quality&mdash;the predominance
of character&mdash;which rules every department of Spanish
achievement.&nbsp; It still lives in the vigorous and
characteristic Spanish painters of to-day&mdash;such, for
instance, as Zuloaga, Anglada-Camarasa, and Sorolla, artists who
take high rank among European painters.</p>
<p>It is often contended that Spanish paintings, if we except the
works of the masters El Greco, Velazquez, and Goya, are wanting
in dignity, wanting in beauty.&nbsp; But are we <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>not too apt
to confine beauty to certain forms of accepted expression?&nbsp;
Surely, any art that interprets life has beauty; and no one can
doubt, who knows the Spanish pictures, that life was the
inspiration of these painters.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The Spanish character speaks in every Spanish picture.&nbsp;
There is one quality, which at a first knowledge will impress the
careful observer, in all these pictures, which, though different,
all have one aim&mdash;it is their dramatic seriousness.&nbsp;
Rarely do you meet with a picture in which the idea of beauty,
whether it be the beauty of colour or the beauty of form, has
stood first in the painter&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Almost in vain
will you search for any love of landscape, for any passage of
beauty introduced for its own sake.&nbsp; Pictures of Passion
scenes, of Assumptions, of martyrdoms and saintly legends, were
painted with a vivid belief in the reality of these things, by
men who felt the presence of the Divine life as a part of human
life.&nbsp; To see these pictures in which <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>homely
details are introduced into the most sacred themes is to
understand the Spaniard&rsquo;s easy familiarity with his
religion.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Spanish painters always treat a
vision as a real scene, and why, too, they present religious and
saintly characters by Spanish models.&nbsp; There is a Spanish
picture by Zurbaran in the National Gallery of London; it is
entitled &ldquo;St. Margaret.&rdquo;&nbsp; You look at the
picture; you see a Spanish lady, her face powdered, as was the
fashion; an embroidered saddle-bag hangs on one arm, in the other
hand she holds a rosary.&nbsp; She is dressed in the picturesque
Andalusian costume.&nbsp; I always smile when I look at this
picture, it is so truly Spanish.&nbsp; The incongruity of
clothing saintship in the garb of fashion would not be evident to
Spanish Zurbaran; he could not see a saint, therefore he painted
a woman, but in accordance with the custom of the day he called
her a &ldquo;saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Spanish pictures tell stories.&nbsp; The successes of
her painters are due to this aim; <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>their failures, to the sacrifice of
beauty of ideal to this&mdash;a danger from which, perhaps, no
painter except Velazquez quite escaped.&nbsp; He alone, faultless
in the balance of his exquisite vision, was saved quite from this
danger of overstatement.&nbsp; It is the special gift of the
whole school, from the time of the early painters of Andalusia to
the time of Goya, to present a scene just as the painter supposed
it might have happened.&nbsp; Was not their aim to translate
life&mdash;the life of earth and the truer life of heaven?&nbsp;
And to the Spaniard, we must remember, life was always
dramatic.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We find a sort of wild delight in martyrdom, as, for instance,
in the pictures of Ribera&mdash;a joy that is perfectly sincere
in pain and in the scourging of the body.&nbsp; There are
pictures horrible with the sense of death and human
corruption.&nbsp; Again and again is enforced the Catholic lesson
of humility, expressing itself in acts of charity to the poor,
such as exists to-day in the custom of the washing of feet at the
Easter <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>celebrations in Seville.&nbsp; There is a childlike
sincerity in these pictures which compels us to accept and
realize what the painter himself believed in.</p>
<p>I recall the pictures of Zurbaran in the museum of Seville,
pictures which carry you into a world of realism, a world in
which visions are translated into the facts of life, set forth
with a childlike simplicity of statement.&nbsp; Each picture is a
scene from the life of old Spain.&nbsp; What honesty is here,
what singular striving to record the truth!&nbsp; (The word
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; is used in a restricted sense.&nbsp; Zurbaran
understood nothing of the inner suggestiveness of art; to him art
meant facts, not vision.)&nbsp; The peasants in his religious
scenes are almost startling in their outward resemblance to
life.&nbsp; How simple is his rendering of the Scriptural scenes,
his conceptions of the Christ!&nbsp; With what poignant reality
he depicts the Crucifixion, a subject exactly suited to his
art!&nbsp; His saints are all portraits, faces caught in a
mirror, the types of old Spain.&nbsp; No one has painted saints
as <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>Zurbaran has done.&nbsp; Before his saints gained their
sanctity they must have struggled as men; and as we look at the
cold, strong faces we come to know the spiritual instinct that
belongs to every true Spaniard.</p>
<p>Among the Spanish priests to-day, and especially in those
living in the country districts of Castile, the observant
stranger will see the types represented in Zurbaran&rsquo;s
pictures.&nbsp; In the faces of these men, as, indeed, in their
whole appearance, there is a profound asceticism, a sort of
energy concentrated in a white heat of devotion.&nbsp; I have
never seen the same type in Italy, or among the priests of any
country.&nbsp; But often when watching a Spanish priest, in the
services of the Church or walking alone on the roads, I have felt
that I understood the meaning of the phrase, &ldquo;This man has
embraced religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all the Spanish painters art was serious&mdash;a matter of
heaven, not of earth.&nbsp; Each painter was conscious of the
presence of the Divine life, giving seriousness as well as <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>joy to
earthly life.&nbsp; It is this which gives Spanish painting a
special interest to the student of Spain.&nbsp; In their
ever-present religious sense, in their adherence, almost brutal
at times, to facts, as well as in those interludes of sensuous
sweetness which now and again, as, for instance, in the facile
and pleasing art of Murillo, burst out so strangely like an
exotic bloom, the Spanish pictures reflect the temper of
Spain.</p>
<p>No one can understand Spanish painting who does not know the
Spanish character.&nbsp; I think, too, that nothing reveals to
the stranger more truly the Spanish character, which is at once
so simple and yet so difficult, in its apparent contradictions,
to comprehend, as a knowledge of the art of her painters.</p>

232</span>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ABOUT MANY THINGS</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Real Spirit of Spain&mdash;The Spiritual
Instinct of the Race&mdash;The Escorial&mdash;Spanish
Beggars&mdash;The Spaniard belongs to the Past, but also to the
Future.</p>
<p>What is the real spirit of Spain?&nbsp; We are now in a better
position to attempt an answer.&nbsp; The word which I should use
to represent the main impression made upon me by the character of
the average Spaniard, the soldier, the bull-fighter, the priest,
the gentleman, the peasant, is individualism; and it seems to me
that this attitude explains Spain&rsquo;s greatness in the past,
and also her position to-day.&nbsp; A love of independence, a
kind of passionate egotism, and a clannish preference for small
social groups, has always distinguished this race.&nbsp; To his
<a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>friends,
even when they have injured him, the Spaniard is invariably
indulgent; but those who are outside his circle he regards with
indifference, which quickly rises to enmity.</p>
<p>Spain has always been the country of great
personalities.&nbsp; Her brilliant achievements in every
department of life&mdash;in warfare, in travel, in politics, in
literature, and in the arts&mdash;have ever been the result of
individual, and not of collective, genius.&nbsp; Velazquez is the
world&rsquo;s greatest painter; Cervantes, the world&rsquo;s
greatest story-teller.&nbsp; The Spanish spirit, with its
wide-ranging energy for dramatic enterprise and its passion for
personal freedom, has filled Spain in the past with martyrs and
heroes.</p>
<p>The Spaniard has two devotions: his observance of the
traditions of his race, and his religion.&nbsp; The ceremonies of
life, which he never forgets to practise, are so real in his
hands that they become quite simple and natural.&nbsp; He may
commit a crime sooner <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>than forget to behave
gracefully.&nbsp; Every Spaniard, be he beggar, peasant, or
prince, acts in the tradition of his race, by which every man is
equal and a gentleman.</p>
<p>There is an inscription on the staircase of the Ayuntamiento
(Town Hall) of Toledo which is worth quoting as an instance of
the Spanish attitude to duty: &ldquo;Noble and judicious men who
govern Toledo, leave your passions on this staircase&mdash;leave
there love, fear, and desire of gain.&nbsp; For the public
benefit forget every private interest, and serve God; He has made
you the pillars of this august place, be firm and
upright.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p235.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Religion is the great devotion of the Spaniard: it is much
more than an attendance upon forms; it is a profound sentiment,
which in him is the spirit of acceptance.&nbsp; In the sphere of
devotion this people know no limit to self-sacrifice.&nbsp; It is
not without significance that Ferrer, the greatest of later-day
martyrs, was a Spaniard.&nbsp; The spiritual instinct is the
deepest instinct of the race.&nbsp; In the faces of many
peasants, <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>and in some of the dwellers in the towns, I have seen
often the making of martyrs and fanatics.&nbsp; The gloom, so
helpful to the emotion of worship, which pervades all Spanish
churches is one instance of how truly they comprehend the needs
of the devotional spirit.&nbsp; The ecstatic attitudes which may
be noted almost everywhere in the worshippers in the churches is
quite unlike anything that will be seen in other
countries&mdash;in Italy, for example, or in France.&nbsp; And
religion is so real a thing, so truly a part of life, that
immediately after this absorbed prayer they will talk and laugh
together.</p>
<p>But if you would understand the spiritual instinct which so
remarkably unites the life of this world with the
after-life&mdash;the instinct which is really at the root of the
true nature of the Spaniard&mdash;there is one building that the
stranger must not fail to visit: it is the Escorial, the Royal
Temple to Death.&nbsp; The spirit of the Escorial is in one
aspect the spirit of Spain.&nbsp; There is nothing in the <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>country
more impressive than this mighty Palace of the Dead.&nbsp; It was
built, as all the world knows, by Philip II., the richest and
most powerful of Kings, in fulfilment of a vow made on the day of
the Battle of St. Quentin.&nbsp; We see the suite of small dark
rooms which he prepared for himself, wherein he might make ready
for death.&nbsp; And how Spanish are these barely furnished rooms
set in the midst of a palace&mdash;this withdrawal from all the
things of this world to prepare for the life of the next
world!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p239.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>It is in the Pantheon of the Escorial that the Spanish Kings
are buried.&nbsp; The great outer doors of the palace are never
opened except when the Sovereigns come for the first time to the
Escorial, and when their bodies are brought there to the vault
which awaits them.&nbsp; The Pantheon is a small octagon; it is
lined with polished marbles, which are crumbling away with a
strange decomposition.&nbsp; The sarcophagi, all exactly alike,
are placed in niches that cover all the wall space; almost every
niche is occupied, <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>but a few empty ones await the living.&nbsp; An altar
with a crucifix of black marble upon a pedestal of porphyry
stands opposite the doorway.&nbsp; The chamber is very cold, and
is penetrated only by a few rays of half-extinguished light.</p>
<p>To-day tourists flock to the Escorial: English, American,
French&mdash;a strange procession!&nbsp; They seem curiously out
of place; their expressions of admiration are grotesque in their
incongruity.&nbsp; There is a deathly solemnity about this mighty
palace that has something ferocious, almost, in its suggestion.
Yes, to see this immense building, with its simple structure
which corresponds so perfectly with the emotion of the place, set
in such splendid isolation amidst the grey and sombre mountains
of Old Castile, where it seems but a part of the desolate
landscape, is to realize that insistence on death and acceptance
of pain which is so real a part of the Spanish spirit&mdash;the
shadow which, in spite of all her joyous life, haunts this
romantic and fascinating land.&nbsp; And the <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>sensitive
stranger will feel again that he understands the cruelty that has
surprised him sometimes in the character of her people.</p>
<p>It was from the Moors that the Spaniards inherited their
readiness to sacrifice themselves for a cause, and this genius
for sacrifice has made them heroes, martyrs, and conspirators; it
has given them their strength, and also their weakness.&nbsp;
This people can resign themselves to anything, and resignation
can just as easily be heroism or mere apathy.&nbsp; The heroic
side of this power gave Spain the greatness of her past history;
the other side, the resignation that is apathy, may be seen
everywhere in Spain to-day.&nbsp; One instance is the beggars who
follow you in the streets of every town, with their incessant cry
for alms.&nbsp; There is terrible poverty in Spain, of which
these hordes of beggars are but a too genuine sign.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Begging is a profession of which no one is ashamed.&nbsp; And
what impressed me most was that only rarely did the beggar appear
unhappy.&nbsp; <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>They all seemed to find their own enjoyment in that
open-air life in the sun which is the happiness of Spain.&nbsp; I
recall one beggar who always sat at the door of the Cathedral of
Leon.&nbsp; He was very old.&nbsp; The cloak in which he was
wrapped was so worn and threadbare that one wondered how the rags
held together.&nbsp; He never appeared to move; through each day
he kept the same position.&nbsp; His face was a mass of wrinkles
which showed strongly from the ingrained dirt.&nbsp; There was a
patient humour in his eyes, which were still bright.&nbsp; His
face reminded me of Velazquez&rsquo; picture.&nbsp; He seemed
quite content when I refused his cry for alms, so that I gave the
answer that Spanish courtesy demands, &ldquo;Perdone usted, por
el amor de Dios!&rdquo; (Excuse me, brother, for the love of
God!).&nbsp; He hardly troubled to hold out his hand.&nbsp; It
was warm where he sat in the sunshine; a shadow from the
sculptured figures of saints and angels, which ornamented the
portal, fell on him pleasantly.&nbsp; Someone will give to him
some day; he <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>was quite content.&nbsp; He was a man of Spain.</p>
<p>Spain has something from of old, which the younger countries
of the world, with all their headlong progress, have as yet only
begun to gain.&nbsp; That something is tradition.&nbsp; It is
interesting to note for one&rsquo;s self the signs of this
tradition in the daily life of the people&mdash;in their fine
understanding of the art of living, in their unfailing courtesy,
in their kindness in all personal relationships.&nbsp; I have
never known a people with so little thought of themselves or care
for personal gain.&nbsp; The greatest gift of their inheritance
is a splendid capacity for sacrifice.&nbsp; And if, as must be
acknowledged, this quality has led them often into evil,
nevertheless it will, with awakened knowledge, gain their
redemption.</p>

<p>In England, and even more in America&mdash;the newest as Spain
is one of the oldest of civilizations&mdash;business is the only
respectable pursuit, including under business literature and the
arts, which in these countries are <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>departments of business.&nbsp; In
Spain this is not so; there are other aims and other traditions,
havens of refuge from the prevalent commercialism.</p>
<p>The duty of expending great labour to gain the little good of
money is not as yet understood by the Spaniards.&nbsp; They have
always been, and still are, a people who stand definitely for art
and the beauty of life&mdash;men and women whose spiritual
instinct enables them to open windows to the stars, and through
these windows, in passing, the stranger sometimes looks.</p>

<p>Literature and art in Spain rest on a long tradition which has
not only produced pictures, carvings, splendid buildings, and
books, but has left its mark on the language, the manners, the
ideas, and the habits of the people.&nbsp; And even though in
every art the technical tradition has been interrupted, there
remains the tradition of feeling.&nbsp; Spain is one of the few
uncommercial countries where the artist and the author are still
esteemed as worthy and profitable <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>members of the community.&nbsp;
Spanish paper money bears the portraits of men of letters and
great painters.&nbsp; Goya&rsquo;s etchings are reproduced on the
pictures used as stiffeners in the packets of cigarettes.</p>
<p>It is this ever-present consciousness of a great tradition,
which we may call an understanding of &ldquo;good manners,&rdquo;
meaning by this the art of beautiful living, finding its
expression as it does in the common life of the people, that
makes it true that, though the Spaniard belongs to the Past, he
belongs also to the Future.&nbsp; He has the qualities which
younger nations now are striving to gain.</p>
<p>Side by side with the new growth of material prosperity, which
has been so marked in the country in recent years, there is
to-day a corresponding movement of spiritual reawakening.&nbsp;
When education spreads among the people, when the over-scrupulous
submission to authority, which has given power to the officialism
of Church and State, shall have found new channels of duty, we
shall <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>cease to hear dismal prophecies of Spain&rsquo;s
downfall.&nbsp; By the splendid spiritual qualities of her people
Spain will be saved.&nbsp; She will be born again before many
years have passed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
